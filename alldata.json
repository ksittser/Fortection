CRIMESTOP means the faculty\r\nof stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any dangerous\r\nthought. It includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing to\r\nperceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if\r\nthey are inimical to Ingsoc, and of being bored or repelled by any train\r\nof thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction. CRIMESTOP,\r\nin short, means protective stupidity... orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over one's own\r\nmental processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his body.",

                    "excerpt": "Winston examined the four slips of paper which he had unrolled. Each contained a message of only one or two lines, in the abbreviated jargon \u0097 not actually Newspeak, but consisting largely of Newspeak words \u0097 which was used in the Ministry for internal purposes. They ran:\r\n\r\ntimes 17.3.84 bb speech malreported africa rectify\r\ntimes 19.12.83 forecasts 3 yp 4th quarter 83 misprints verify current issue\r\ntimes 14.2.84 miniplenty malquoted chocolate rectify\r\ntimes 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a faint feeling of satisfaction Winston laid the fourth message aside. It was an intricate and responsible job and had better be dealt with last. The other three were routine matters, though the second one would probably mean some tedious wading through lists of figures.\r\n\r\nWinston dialled \u0091back numbers\u0092 on the telescreen and called for the appropriate issues of \u0091The Times\u0092, which slid out of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes\u0092 delay. The messages he had received referred to articles or news items which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter, or, as the official phrase had it, to rectify. For example, it appeared from \u0091The Times\u0092 of the seventeenth of March that Big Brother, in his speech of the previous day, had predicted that the South Indian front would remain quiet but that a Eurasian offensive would shortly be launched in North Africa. As it happened, the Eurasian Higher Command had launched its offensive in South India and left North Africa alone. It was therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of Big Brother\u0092s speech, in such a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened. Or again, \u0091The Times\u0092 of the nineteenth of December had published the official forecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of 1983, which was also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. Today\u0092s issue contained a statement of the actual output, from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly wrong. Winston\u0092s job was to rectify the original figures by making them agree with the later ones. As for the third message, it referred to a very simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes. As short a time ago as February, the Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise (a \u0091categorical pledge\u0092 were the official words) that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984. Actually, as Winston was aware, the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the end of the present week. All that was needed was to substitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in April.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages, he clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of \u0091The Times\u0092 and pushed them into the pneumatic tube. Then, with a movement which was as nearly as possible unconscious, he crumpled up the original message and any notes that he himself had made, and dropped them into the memory hole to be devoured by the flames.\r\n\r\nWhat happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led, he did not know in detail, but he did know in general terms. As soon as all the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number of \u0091The Times\u0092 had been assembled and collated, that number would be reprinted, the original copy destroyed, and the corrected copy placed on the files in its stead. This process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers, but to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films, sound-tracks, cartoons, photographs \u0097 to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or ideological significance. Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date. In this way every prediction made by the Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct, nor was any item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record. All history was a palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary. In no case would it have been possible, once the deed was done, to prove that any falsification had taken place. The largest section of the Records Department, far larger than the one on which Winston worked, consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect all copies of books, newspapers, and other documents which had been superseded and were due for destruction. A number of \u0091The Times\u0092 which might, because of changes in political alignment, or mistaken prophecies uttered by Big Brother, have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearing its original date, and no other copy existed to contradict it. Books, also, were recalled and rewritten again and again, and were invariably reissued without any admission that any alteration had been made. Even the written instructions which Winston received, and which he invariably got rid of as soon as he had dealt with them, never stated or implied that an act of forgery was to be committed: always the reference was to slips, errors, misprints, or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the interests of accuracy.",

It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live -- did live, from habit that became instinct -- in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.",

In submarine works, the workman, clad in an impervious dress, with his head in a metal helmet, receives air from above by means of forcing pumps and regulators.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a diving apparatus,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Just so, but under these conditions the man is not at liberty; he is attached to the pump which sends him air through an india-rubber tube, and if we were obliged to be thus held to the Nautilus, we could not go far.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the means of getting free?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"It is to use the Rouquayrol apparatus, invented by two of your own countrymen, which I have brought to perfection for my own use, and which will allow you to risk yourself under these new physiological conditions without any organ whatever suffering. It consists of a reservoir of thick iron plates, in which I store the air under a pressure of fifty atmospheres.  This reservoir is fixed on the back by means of braces, like a soldier's knapsack. Its upper part forms a box in which the air is kept by means of a bellows, and therefore cannot escape unless at its normal tension.\r\nIn the Rouquayrol apparatus such as we use, two india rubber pipes leave this box and join a sort of tent which holds the nose and mouth; one is to introduce fresh air, the other to let out the foul, and the tongue closes one or the other according to the wants of the respirator.\r\nBut I, in encountering great pressures at the bottom of the sea, was obliged to shut my head, like that of a diver in a ball of copper; and it is to this ball of copper that the two pipes, the inspirator and the expirator, open.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly, Captain Nemo; but the air that you carry with you must soon be used; when it only contains fifteen per cent. of oxygen it is no longer fit to breathe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right!  But I told you, M. Aronnax, that the pumps of the Nautilus allow me to store the air under considerable pressure, and on those conditions the reservoir of the apparatus can furnish breathable air for nine or ten hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no further objections to make,\" I answered.\r\n\"I will only ask you one thing, Captain--how can you light your\r\nroad at the bottom of the sea?\"\r\n\r\n\"With the Ruhmkorff apparatus, M. Aronnax; one is carried on the back,\r\nthe other is fastened to the waist.  It is composed of a Bunsen pile,\r\nwhich I do not work with bichromate of potash, but with sodium.\r\nA wire is introduced which collects the electricity produced, and directs\r\nit towards a particularly made lantern.  In this lantern is a spiral glass\r\nwhich contains a small quantity of carbonic gas.  When the apparatus is at\r\nwork this gas becomes luminous, giving out a white and continuous light.\r\nThus provided, I can breathe and I can see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain Nemo, to all my objections you make such crushing answers that I\r\ndare no longer doubt.",

There Ned Land and Conseil were slyly watching some of the ship's crew, who were opening the hatches, while cries of rage and fearful vociferations resounded outside.\r\n\r\nThe port lids were pulled down outside.  Twenty horrible faces appeared. But the first native who placed his hand on the stair-rail, struck from behind\r\nby some invisible force, I know not what, fled, uttering the most fearful\r\ncries and making the wildest contortions.\r\n\r\nTen of his companions followed him.

Some are known to you, such as the thermometer, which gives the internal temperature of the Nautilus; the barometer, which indicates the weight\r\nof the air and foretells the changes of the weather; the hygrometer, which marks the dryness of the atmosphere; the storm-glass, the contents of which, by decomposing, announce the approach of tempests; the compass,\r\nwhich guides my course; the sextant, which shows the latitude by the altitude\r\nof the sun; chronometers, by which I calculate the longitude; and glasses\r\nfor day and night, which I use to examine the points of the horizon,\r\nwhen the Nautilus rises to the surface of the waves.\"\r\n\r\n   \"There is a powerful agent, obedient, rapid, easy, which conforms to every use, and reigns \r\n\r\nsupreme on board my vessel.

I could manufacture the air necessary for my consumption, but it\r\nis useless, because I go up to the surface of the water when I please.\r\nHowever, if electricity does not furnish me with air to breathe, it works\r\nat least the powerful pumps that are stored in spacious reservoirs,\r\nand which enable me to prolong at need, and as long as I will, my stay\r\nin the depths of the sea.  It gives a uniform and unintermittent light,\r\nwhich the sun does not.  Now look at this clock; it is electrical,\r\nand goes with a regularity that defies the best chronometers.\r\nI have divided it into twenty-four hours, like the Italian clocks,\r\nbecause for me there is neither night nor day, sun nor moon, but only\r\nthat factitious light that I take with me to the bottom of the sea.\r\nLook! just now, it is ten o'clock in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another application of electricity.  This dial hanging in front of us\r\nindicates the speed of the Nautilus.  An electric thread puts it in\r\ncommunication with the screw, and the needle indicates the real speed.\r\nLook! now we are spinning along with a uniform speed of fifteen\r\nmiles an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is marvelous!  And I see, Captain, you were right to make use\r\nof this agent that takes the place of wind, water, and steam...\"\r\n\r\nReally, I knew already the anterior part of this submarine boat,\r\nof which this is the exact division, starting from the ship's head:\r\nthe dining-room, five yards long, separated from the library\r\nby a water-tight partition; the library, five yards long;\r\nthe large drawing-room, ten yards long, separated from the Captain's\r\nroom by a second water-tight partition; the said room, five yards\r\nin length; mine, two and a half yards; and, lastly a reservoir\r\nof air, seven and a half yards, that extended to the bows.\r\nTotal length thirty five yards, or one hundred and five feet.\r\nThe partitions had doors that were shut hermetically by means of\r\nindia-rubber instruments, and they ensured the safety of the Nautilus\r\nin case of a leak.",

They were free from all boredom and all responsibility; until they reached Saturn, the external world did not exist.\r\n\r\nBut that world was watching them, through their bio-sensor displays. Tucked inconspicuously away among the massed instrumentation of the Control Deck were five small panels marked Hunter, Whitehead, Kaminski, Poole, Bowman. The last two were blank and lifeless; their time would not come until a year from now. The others bore constellations of tiny green lights, announcing that everything was well; and on each was a small display screen across which sets of glowing lines traced the leisurely rhythms that indicated pulse, respiration, and brain activity.\r\n\r\nMost fascinating of all were the EEG displays - the electronic signatures of three personalities that had once existed, and would one day exist again. They were almost free from the spikes and valleys, the electrical explosions that marked the activity of the waking brain - or even of the brain in normal sleep. If there was any wisp of consciousness remaining, it was beyond the reach of instruments, and of memory.\r\n\r\nThis last fact Bowman knew from personal experience. Before he was chosen for this mission, his reactions to hibernation had been tested. He was not sure whether he had lost a week of his life - or whether he had postponed his eventual death by the same amount of time.\r\n\r\nWhen the electrodes had been attached to his forehead, and the sleep-generator had started to pulse, he had seen a brief display of kaleidoscopic patterns and drifting stars. Then they had faded, and darkness had engulfed him. He had never felt the injections, still less the first touch of cold as his body temperature was reduced to only a few degrees above freezing.",

On Earth and Moon, less than a hundred people had so far been allowed to set eyes on this photograph.\r\n\r\nIt showed a man in a bright red and yellow spacesuit standing at the bottom of an excavation and supporting a surveyor's rod marked off in tenths of a meter. It was obviously a night shot, and might have been taken anywhere on the Moon or Mars. But until now no planet had ever produced a scene like this.\r\n\r\nThe object before which the spacesuited man was posing was a vertical slab of jet-black material, about ten feet high and five feet wide: it reminded Floyd, somewhat ominously, of a giant tombstone. Perfectly sharp-edged and symmetrical, it was so black it seemed to have swallowed up the light falling upon it; there was no surface detail at all. It was impossible to tell whether it was made of stone or metal or plastic - or some material altogether unknown to man.\r\n\r\n\"TMA-1,\" Dr. Michaels declared, almost reverently. \"It looks brand new, doesn't it? I can hardly blame those who thought it was just a few years old, and tried to connect it with the third Chinese Expedition, back in '98. But I never believed that - and now we've been able to date it positively, from local geological evidence.\r\n\r\n\"My colleagues and I, Dr. Floyd, will stake our reputations on this. TMA-l has nothing to do with the Chinese. Indeed, it has nothing to do with the human race - for when it was buried, there were no humans. \r\n\r\n\"You see, it is approximately three million years old. What you are now looking at is the first evidence of intelligent life beyond the Earth.\" \r\n",

It shriveled, blackened\r\nand burst into flame. Then a lead\r\npencil\u0097it melted off midway of its length\r\nas I held it up.\r\nFreddie snapped off the apparatus.\r\n\"That's all, gentlemen.

Beside me, I could hear Duke acknowledging each of the other vehicles as they slid into position around the dome. I didn't bother to look up. I knew that the teams were already dropping out of their vehicles, torches at the ready. We were eight tight little islands of death. Priority one: survive. Dead heroes do not win wars.\r\n\r\nThe green ready light came up. I slid the console back and pulled the spider control board up and into position. I slipped the goggles over my head, waited for my vision to clear, and slipped my hands into the control gloves.\r\n\r\nThere was the usual moment of discontinuity, and then I was in the spider. I was looking through its eyes, hearing through its ears, feeling through its hands. \"Forward,\" I said, and the point of view moved down, out of the forward ramp of the rollagon, and forward toward the quiet-looking dome.\r\n\r\nMy point of view was closer to the ground than I was used to, and my eyes were farther apart, so everything looked smaller-and the perspective was deeper. I needed this walk to slip into my \"spider-consciousness mode.\" I had to get into the feeling of it.\r\n\r\nThe military spiders were hasty adaptations of the industrial models. This one had a black metal body, eight skinny legs-each ending in a large black hoof-and an observation turret. The spider could function with half its legs disabled; any two of its legs could also function as arms. There was a waldo inside each hoof, complete with tactile sensors.",

                    "excerpt": "I launched a skyball-an aerial drone-for one last look-see before we went in.\r\n\r\nThe image on the screen tilted and swooped dizzily as the skyball skidded and slid across the sky. It was having trouble navigating in the wind. After a moment, though, it figured out what it was doing and the image steadied into a long glide...\r\n\r\nI nodded and tapped at the keyboard, bringing the drone lower. The image turned slowly as the skyball circled the nest. I punched for scanning. The image shifted colors then: blue for cold, red for hot, yellow for in between. Most of the screen was orange. I had to turn down the range.\r\n\r\nThe corrected scan was mostly green and yellow. A faint orange track led to the dome. Or away from it. The track was at least an hour old.\r\n\r\nI glanced at Duke; his expression was unreadable. \"Scan the dome,\" he said.\r\n\r\nWe knew that the worms were hot when they were active. But we also knew that when they went torpid-which was usually during the hottest part of the day-their body temperatures could drop as much as thirty degrees. That was why the earliest mobile probes had failed to register their presence. The worms had been too cool.\r\n\r\nWe knew better now.\r\n\r\nThe worms went deep and they went cold. Men had died to find that out.\r\n\r\nThe skyball came in low and close now. The dome filled the screen. I punched in a sonic-scan overlay. There was something there, all right-a dark blue mass, mottled with quickly shifting colors. It was large and deep below the surface.\r\n\r\nThe screen said it massed four tons.\r\n\r\n\"That's a good-sized family,\" said Duke. \"Can we take 'em?\" \r\n\r\nI was wondering the same thing, \"Denver says the gas is good. This is at the upper end of the range, but it's within the limit.\" \r\n\r\n\"How do you feel about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said Duke. \"So do I.\" He thumbed his mike. \"All units. It's a go. I repeat, it is a go. Proceed to your final positions. This is it.\"\r\n\r\nWe were committed now. There were no more Go-NoGo points. Duke leaned forward and rapped our driver. \"Come on-let's move!\" The big rollagon trundled forward, up a small ridge and then down the long slope on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nI pulled the skyball up and directed it to circle the dome on a continual scan. If there was any change in heat level, it would sound an immediate alarm. We would have between ten and ninety seconds' warning-depending on the worms. I checked my earphones and mike. This was the most dangerous part of the mission. We were too vulnerable to ambush on the approach.",

Matt had never before seen a house which was not painted, but he had to admire the effect. The remnants of the shaping balloon, which gave all architectural coral buildings their telltale bulge, had been carefully scraped away. The exposed walls had been polished to a shining pink sheen. Even after sunset the house glowed softly...\r\n\r\nArchitectural coral was another gift of the ramrobots. A genetic manipulation of ordinary sea coral, it was the cheapest building material known. The only real cost was in the plastic balloon that guided the growth of the coral and enclosed the coral's special air-borne food. ",

The helmets were smaller, and not having to withstand outside pressure they were made of welded aluminum, lined thickly with asbestos, not to keep the cold out, but the heat in. On the back of the dress there was a square case, looking like a knapsack, containing the expanding apparatus, which would furnish breathable air for an almost unlimited time as long as the liquefied air from a cylinder hung below it passed through the cells in which the breathed air had been deprived of its carbonic acid gas and other noxious ingredients. The pressure of air inside the helmet automatically regulated the supply, which was not permitted to circulate through the other portions of the dress. The reasons for this precaution were very simple. Granted the absence of atmosphere on the moon, any air in the dress, which was woven of a cunning compound of silk and asbestos, would instantly expand with irresistible force, burst the covering, and expose the limbs of the explorers to a cold which would be infinitely more destructive than the hottest of earthly fires. It would wither them to nothing in a moment. A human hand or foot--we won't say anything about faces--exposed to the summer or winter temperature of the moon--that is to say, to its sunlight and its darkness--would be shrivelled into dry bone in a moment, and therefore Lord Redgrave, foreseeing this, had provided the breathing-dresses. Lastly, the two helmets were connected, for purposes of conversation, by a light wire, the two ends of which were connected with a little telephonic receiver and transmitter inside each of the head-dresses",

Exactly at midnight a faint phosphorescent light, like that of a glow-worm, appeared in the region of Greenland on the planet they had left. It gradually increased its strength till it shone like a long white beam projected from a lighthouse, and in this they beheld the work of the greatest search-light ever made by man, receiving for a few moments all the electricity generated by the available dynamos at Niagara and the Bay of Fundy, the steam engines, and other sources of power in the northern hemisphere. The beam lasted with growing intensity for one minute; it then spelled out with clean-cut intervals, according to the Cable Code: \"23\u00b0 no' 6\". The southern hemisphere pumps are now raising and storing water at full blast. We have already begun to lower the Arctic Ocean.\"\r\n\n\n\n(The arctic signal light)\n\n\r\nOn receiving this last earthly message, the travellers sprang to their searchlight, and, using its full power, telegraphed back the following: \"Many thanks to you for good news about earth, and to Secretary Deepwaters for lending us the navy. Result of work most glorious. Remember us to everybody. Shadow's edge approaching.\"\r\n\r\nThis was read by the men in the great observatories, who evidently telephoned to the arctic Signal Light immediately, for it flashed back: \"Got your message perfectly.

This, of necessity brought in good roads, the results obtainable on such being so much greater than on bad ones that a universal demand for them arose. This was in a sense cumulative, since the better the streets and roads became, the greater the inducement to have an electric carriage. The work of opening up the country far and near, by straightening and improving existing roads, and laying out new ones that combine the solidity of the Appian Way with the smoothness of modern asphalt, was largely done by convicts, working under the direction of State and Government engineers. Every State contained a horde of these unprofitable boarders, who, as they formerly worked, interfered with honest labour, and when idle got into trouble. City streets had been paved by the municipality; country roads attended to by the farmers, usually very unscientifically. Here was a field in which convict labour would not compete, and an important work could be done. When once this was made the law, every year showed improvement, while the convicts had useful and healthful occupation.\r\n   \"The electric phaetons, as those for high speed are called, have three and four wheels, and weigh, including battery and motor, five hundred to four thousand pounds. With hollow but immensely strong galvanically treated aluminum frames and pneumatic or cushion tires, they run at thirty-five and forty miles an hour on country roads, and attain a speed over forty on city streets, and can maintain this rate without recharging for several days. They can therefore roam over the roads of the entire hemisphere, from the fertile valley of the Peace and grey shores of Hudson Bay, to beautiful Lake Nicaragua, the River Plate, and Patagonia, improving man by bringing him close to Nature, while they combine the sensations of coasting with the interest of seeing the country well.\r\n   \"To recharge the batteries, which can be done in almost every town and village, two copper pins attached to insulated copper wires are shoved into smooth-bored holes....\r\n   \"We are freed from the rattling granite pavement of only a century ago, which made the occupant of an omnibus feel like a fly inside of a drum; from the domination of our local politics by ignorant foreigners; and from country roads that either filled the eyes, lungs, and hair of the unfortunates travelling upon them with dust, or, resembling ploughed and fertilized fields, saturated and plastered them with mud.

At present the earth's axis -- that is, the line passing through its centre and the two poles -- is inclined to the ecliptic about twenty-three and a half degrees. Our summer is produced by the northern hemisphere's leaning at that angle towards the sun, and our winter by its turning that much from it. In one case the sun's rays are caused to shine more perpendicularly, and in the other more obliquely. This wabbling, like that of a top, is the sole cause of the seasons; since, owing to the eccentricity of our orbit, the earth is actually fifteen hundred thousand miles nearer the sun during our winter, in the northern hemisphere, than in summer. That there is no limit to a planet's inclination, and that inclination is not essential, we have astronomical proof. Venus's axis is inclined to the plane of her orbit seventy-five degrees, so that the arctic circle comes within fifteen degrees of the equator, and the tropics also extend to latitude seventy-five degrees, or within fifteen degrees of the poles, producing great extremes of heat and cold...\r\n   \"The way to accomplish this is to increase the weight of the pole leaving the sun, by increasing the amount of material there for the sun to attract, and to lighten the pole approaching or turning towards the sun, by removing some heavy substance from it, and putting it preferably at the opposite pole. This shifting of ballast is most easily accomplished, as you will readily perceive, by confining and removing water, which is easily moved and has a considerable weight.\r\n",

On passing a magnet, the nature of the electricity charging a car is automatically changed from positive to negative, or vice versa, to that of the magnet just passed, so that it repels while the next attracts. The successive magnets are charged oppositely, the sections being divided halfway between by insulators, the nature of the electricity in each section being governed by the charge in the magnet. To prevent one kind of electricity from uniting with and neutralizing that in the next section by passing through the car at the moment of transit, there is a \"dead stretch\" of fifty yards with rails not charged at all between the sections. This change in the nature of the electricity is repeated automatically...\r\n   Magnetism being practically as instantaneous as gravitation, the only limitations to speed are the electrical pressure at the magnets, the resistance of the air, and the danger of the wheels bursting from centrifugal force. The first can seemingly be increased without limit; the atmospheric resistance is about to be reduced by running the cars hermetically sealed through a partial vacuum in a steel and toughened glass tube; while the third has been removed indefinitely by the use of galvanized aluminum, which bears about the same relation to ordinary aluminum that steel does to iron, and which has twice the tensile strength and but one third the weight of steel. In some cases the rails are made turned in, so that it would be impossible for a car to leave the track without the road-bed's being totally demolished; but in most cases this is found to be unnecessary, for no through line has a curve on its vast stretches with a radius of less than half a mile. Rails, one hundred and sixty pounds to the yard, are set in grooved steel ties, which in turn are held by a concrete road-bed consisting of broken stone and cement, making spreading rails and loose ballast impossible. A large increase in capital was necessary for these improvements, the elimination of curves being the most laborious part, requiring bridges, cuttings, and embankments that dwarf the Pyramids and would have made the ancient Pharaohs open their eyes; but with the low rate of interest on bonds, the slight cost of power, and great increase in business, the venture was a success, and we are now in sight of further advances that will enable a traveller in a high latitude moving west to keep pace with the sun, and, should he wish it, to have unending day.\"\r\n",

                    "excerpt": "The next improvement in sea travelling was the `marine spider.' As the name shows, this is built on the principle of an insect. It is well known that a body can be carried over the water much faster than through it. With this in mind, builders at first constructed light framework decks on large water-tight wheels or drums, having paddles on their circumferences to provide a hold on the water. These they caused to revolve by means of machinery on the deck, but soon found that the resistance offered to the barrel wheels themselves was too great. They therefore made them more like centipeds with large, bell-shaped feet, connected with a superstructural deck by ankle-jointed pipes, through which, when necessary, a pressure of air can be forced down upon the enclosed surface of water. Ordinarily, however, they go at great speed without this, the weight of the water displaced by the bell feet being as great as that resting upon them. Thus they swing along like a pacing horse, except that there are four rows of feet instead of two, each foot being taken out of the water as it is swung forward, the first and fourth and second and third rows being worked together. Although, on account of their size, which covers several acres, they can go in any water, they give the best results on Mediterraneans and lakes that are free from ocean rollers, and, under favourable conditions, make better speed than the nineteenth-century express trains, and, of course, going straight as the crow flies, and without stopping, they reach a destination in considerably shorter time.",

One massive-headed man in purple was loitering near them, but he was the only person in sight. Allison strode casually over to the nearest car, studying it closely as he went.\r\nIt, like the others, was small, hardly five feet high, with open sides and streamlined shells of a stuff like glass, front and back. Within was one wide seat, in front of which were three control levers which led to a boxed space below. It rested on three splayed legs. And that was all there was. No motive device was apparent, and there were no wings or vanes whatever.\r\nAllison was not pleased to have a witness to his first flight, but he stepped into the nearest car without hesitation and gingerly raised the lever he guessed would be the elevator. The car lifted. Slight pulls on another lever turned the nose of his craft, and the third gave for\u00adward velocity. It was extremely simple. A glance at the man below showed that he wasn\u0092t even look\u00ading. Boldly, now, Allison ordered the controls, and within a minute he was climbing silently a hundred feet above the edge of the roof to where other air-cars like elongated soap bubbles were scattered through the sky above.",

He climbed his little craft over to the great chart table to the forward end of the room where were the banks of dials and the rows of colored buttons whereby the ship was controlled.\r\nA glance at a dial half as large as his ship showed a negligible amount of air outside, so he advanced thirty feet to hover like a humming bird in front of a green button with a large 3 on its face, and, feeling a lit\u00adtle sentimental, reached out and pushed it in. Farther on he pushed in another, which would give him the ship\u0092s maximum acceleration. Then he glided to a landing on the immense flat top of the chart table and sat down. The rest was up to the ship\u0092s automatic navigator.\r\nIt was equal to the job. Its ultra-sensitive receivers picked up and identified every major planetary body in the solar system and sent the information through an over\u00adlapping labyrinth of seventy-two circuits where every navigation fac\u00adtor of location, spacial relation, planetary gravital pulls, ship\u0092s speed and acceleration and deceleration, planetary speeds and orbits, ship\u0092s destination, and so forth, were sec\u00adond by second electrically arranged and coordinated into the necessary resultant course; and it put the ship on that course, and corrected in\u00adfinitesimal strayings, and would without attention start deceleration at the proper time, and bring the ship gently to ground in a place re\u00adserved for it in Earth\u0092s great space port at New York. All that Allison had to do, therefore, was set the buttons for destination and accelera\u00adtion.",

He admitted they did not. \"Look,\" she said, turning her body at an angle and adjusting the stems.\r\n\r\nAS ALLISON looked, close by her side, the dial took on an opalescent glow, and dimly there appeared on it threads and shadows which under her adjustments cleared into a picture, animated\u0097the heads and figures of half a dozen women.\r\n\"Television,\" he said. \"You\u0092re re\u00adceiving this from a broadcasting studio.\"\r\n\"No,\" she corrected; \"a search-beam, portable. I can focus it at a distance on whatever I choose. It passes through almost anything.\"\r\n\r\n... The ethnologist sat on the edge of the cot and held up his wrist. What a marvel of ingenuity the lit\u00adtle device was! Tentatively he turned the stem she had first touched. The dial glowed, then meaningless shadows appeared on it. The slightest movement of his body changed these shadows for new ones. He turned other stems and got what seemed to be a wall. Delicately he manipulated in the attempt to probe beyond. ",

I'd just about scooped it full and most of the warmth had leaked from my fingers when I saw the thing.\r\n\r\nYou know, at first I thought it was a young lady. Yes, a beautiful young lady's face all glowing in the dark and looking at me from the fifth floor of the opposite apartment, which hereabouts is the floor just above the white blanket of frozen air.\r\n\n\n\n(From \"A Pail of Air\" by Fritz Lieber)\n\n\r\nPa handled the pail of air in a twist of cloth. Now that it was inside the Nest, you could really feel its coldness. It just seemed to suck the heat out of everything. Even the flames cringed away from it as Pa put it down close by the fire.\r\n\r\nYet it's that glimmery white stuff in the pail that keeps us alive. It slowly melts and vanishes and refreshes the Nest and feeds the fire...\r\n\r\nYou see, when the Earth got cold, all the water in the air froze first and made a blanket ten feet thick or so everywhere, and then down on top of that dropped the crystals of frozen air, making another white blanket sixty or seventy feet thick maybe.\r\nOf course, all the parts of the air didn't freeze and snow down at the same time.\r\nFirst to drop out was the carbon dioxide\u0097when you're shoveling for water, you have to make sure you don't go too high and get any of that stuff mixed in, for it would put you to sleep, maybe for good, and make the fire go out. Next there's the nitrogen, which doesn't count one way or the other, though it's the biggest part of the blanket. On top of that and easy to get at, which is lucky for us, there's the oxygen that keeps us alive. Pa says we live better than kings ever did, breathing pure oxygen, but we're used to it and don't notice. Finally, at the very top, there's a slick of liquid helium, which is funny stuff. All of these gases in neat separate layers. Like a pussy caffay, Pa laughingly says, whatever that is.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

They got to pull out bureau drawers to see what was taped to the backs. They got to pull apart pole lamps to see if hundreds of tabs sprang out. They got to look down inside toilet bowls to see what sort of little packets in toilet paper were lodged out of sight where the running water would automatically flush them. They got to look in the freezer compartment of the refrigerator to see if any of the packages of frozen peas and beans actually contained frozen dope, slyly mismanked. Meanwhile, the complicated holo-scanners were mounted, with officers seating themselves in various places to test the scanners out. The same with the audio ones. But the video part was more important and took more time. And of course the scanners should never be visible. It took skill to so mount them. A number of locations had to be tried. The technicians who did this got paid well, because if they screwed up and a holo-scanner got detected later on by an occupant of the premises, then the occupants, all of them, would know they had been penetrated and were under scrutiny, and cool their activities. And in addition they would sometimes tear off the whole scanning system and sell it.",

I  don't like riding in the things. You sit there inside a transite hull, which has two bucket seats inside it, fore and aft, astraddle the drive tube, and you guide from one beacon to the next while you keep tabs on orbital positions by radio. It's a  long jump from one rock to the next, even in  the asteroid belt, and you have to live inside your vac suit until you come to a  stopping place where you can spend an hour or so resting before you go on. It's like driving cross-continent in  an automobile, except that the signposts and landmarks are constantly shifting position. An inexperienced man can get lost easily in the Belt.\r\nI was happy to find that Jack Ravenhurst knew how to handle a flitterboat and could sight navigate by the stars. That meant that I could sleep while she piloted and vice-versa. The trip back was a  lot easier and faster than the trip out had been.\r\nI was glad, in a way, that Ceres was within flitterboat range of Raven's Rest. I  don't like the time wasted in waiting for a regular spaceship, which you have to do when your target is  a  quarter of the way around the Belt from you. The cross-system jumps don't take long, but getting to a ship takes time.\r\nThe Ravenhurst girl wasn't much of a  talker while we were en route. A little general chitchat once in  awhile, then she'd clam up to do a little mental orbit figuring. I  didn't mind. I  was in  no mood to pump her just yet, and I was usually figuring orbits myself. You get in the habit after a while.\r\nWhen the Ceres beacon came into view, I was snoozing. Jack reached forward and shook my shoulder.\"\r\nDecelerating toward Ceres,\" she said. \"Want to take over from here on?\" Her voice sounded tinny andtired in the earphones of my fishbowl.\"O.K.; I'll take her in...\"",

Except for relaxed tiny bulges of muscle in forearms and calves (latter to work lengthy toes, useful in gripping), this man was composed of skin, bones, ligaments, fasciae, narrow arteries and veins, nerves, small-size assorted inner organs, ghost muscles, and a big-domed skull with two lumps of jaw muscle. He was wearing a skintight black suit that left bare only his sunken-cheeked, deep-eyes, beautiful tragic face and big, heavy-tendoned hands.\r\n\r\nThis truly magnificent, romantically handsome, rather lean man was standing on two corrugated-soled titanium footplates. From the outer edge of each rose a narrow titanium T-beam that followed the line of his leg, with a joint (locked now) at the knee, up to another joint with a titanium pelvic girdle and shallow belly support. From the back of this girdle a T-spine rose to support a shoulder yoke and rib cage, all of the same metal. The rib cage was artistically slotted to save weight, so that curving strips followed the line of each of his very prominent ribs.\r\n\r\nA continuation of his T-spine up the back of his neck in turn supported a snug, gleaming head basket that rose behind to curve over his shaven cranium, but in front was little more than a jaw shelf and two inward-curving cheekplates stopping just short of his somewhat rudimentary nose...\r\n\r\nSlightly lighter T-beams than those for his legs reinforced his arms and housed in their terminal inches his telescoping canes. Numerous black, foam-padded bands attached his whole framework to him.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n",

                    "excerpt": "I. \"We could even have an electric gun. Conceive a bobbin wound with insulated wire in lieu of thread, and having the usual hole through the axis of the frame. If a current of electricity be sent through the wire, the bobbin will become a hollow magnet or 'solenoid,' and a plug of soft iron placed at one end will be sucked into the hole. In this experiment we have the germ of a solenoid cannon. The bobbin stands for the gun-barrel, the plug for the bullet-car, and the magnetism for the ejecting force. We can arrange the wire and current so as to draw the plug or car right through the hole or barrel, and if we have a series of solenoids end to end in one straight line, we can switch the current through each in succession, and send the projectile with gathering velocity through the interior of them all. In practice the barrel would consist of a long straight tube, wide and strong enough to contain the bullet-car without flexure, and begirt with giant solenoids at intervals. Each of the solenoids would be excited by a powerful current, one after the other, so as to urge the projectile with accelerating speed along the tube, and launch it into the vast.\" \r\nG. \"That looks still better than the pneumatic gun.\" \r\nI. \"A magnetic gun would have several advantages. For instance, the currents can be sent through the solenoids in turn as quickly as we desire by means of a commutator in a convenient spot, for instance, at the butt end of the gun, so as to follow up the bullet with ease, and give it a planetary flight. By a proper adjustment of the solenoids and currents, this could be done so gradually as to prevent a starting shock to the occupants of the car. The velocity attained by the car would, of course, depend on the number and power of the solenoids. If, for example, each solenoid communicated to the car a velocity of nine yards per second, a thousand solenoids, each magnetically stronger than another in going from breech to muzzle, would be required to give a final velocity of five miles a second. In such a case, the length of the barrel would be at least 1,000 yards. Economy and safety would determine the best proportions for the gun, but we are now considering the feasibility of the project, not its cost. With regard to position and supports, the gun might be constructed along the slope of a hill or mound steep enough to give it the angle or elevation due to the aim. As the barrel would not have to resist an explosive force, it should not be difficult to make, and the inside could be lubricated to diminish the friction of the projectile in passing through it. Moreover, it is conceivable that the car need never touch the sides, for by a proper adjustment of the magnetism of the solenoids we might suspend it in mid-air like Mahomet's coffin, and make it glide along the magnetic axis of the tube.\" ",

But there's another reason. Now take a gravital unit. Any gravital unit. Most people think of it as just that\u0097a unit. It isn't really that at all. It has three parts.\r\n\r\n\"One part is a power source that can be anything as long as it's big enough. Our power source is a nuclear pile, buried deep in the asteroid. You'd have to take Handicap Haven apart to get to it. Part two is the gravital coil, which actually produces the gravity and is simple and just about indestructible. Part three is the gravital control. It calculates the relationship between the amount of power flowing through the gravital coil and the strength of the created gravity field in any one microsecond. It uses the computed relationship to alter the power flowing through in the next microsecond to get the same gravity. No change of power, no gravity. I guess you could call the control unit a computer, as good a one as is made for any purpose.\"\r\n\r\nThe engineer rubbed his chin. \"Fatigue,\" he continued. \"The gravital control is an intricate computer that's subject to fatigue. That's why it has to rest an hour and a half to do forty-five minutes of work. Naturally they don't want anyone tinkering with it. It's non-repairable. Crack the case open and it won't work.

The basic procedures underlying its life-cycle are not consciously comprehended by the parasite and have not, at present, been explained.\u2028\r\n\nCycle: . . . the free state, normally forming only a fraction of the Ceetal life-cycle, may be extended indefinitely until the parasite contacts a suitable host-organism. Oxygen-breathing life-forms with neural mechanisms in the general class of the human nervous system and its energy areas serve this purpose.\r\n\r\n\u2028On contacting a host, the Ceetal undergoes changes in itself enabling it to control the basic energizing drives of the host-organism. It then develops the host's neural carriers to a constant point five times beyond the previous absolute emergency overload.\u2028\r\n\r\nIn type-case Ceetal-Homo-Lycanno S-4, 1782\u0097a drastic localized hypertrophy of the central nerve tissue masses was observed, indicating protective measures against the overload induced in the organism.\r\n\r\n\u2028The advantages to the parasite of developing a host-organism of such abnormal potency and efficiency in its environment are obvious, as it is indissolubly linked to its host for the major part of its long parasitic stage and cannot survive the host's death. Barring accidents or superior force, it is, however, capable of prolonging the host's biological life-span almost indefinitely.\r\n\r\n\u2028At the natural end of this stage, the Ceetal reproduces, the individual parasite dividing into eight free-stage forms. The host is killed in the process of division, and each Ceetal is freed thereby to initiate a new cycle.\u2028",

Vasquez picked up a battered wastebasket that had rolled into the corridor and shouted towards the weapon's aural pickup: \"Testing!\" Then she threw the empty metal container out into the middle of the corridor. Both guns swiveled and let loose before the basket hit the floor, reducing the container to dime-sized shrapnel. Hudson whooped with delight. In the service tunnel that connected the buildings of the colony to the processing station and each other, a pair of robot guns sat silently, their motion scanners alert and humming.

From whirling, multicolored fragments it rapidly assembled a tanned Asian face above a dark collar and tie. The face smiled and changed into a Caucasian female, aged fractionally, and I was facing a blonde thirty-year-old woman in a sober business suit.

                    "excerpt": "Walsingham Gribbs looked at my wife, and then \r\nsmiled. \r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" he said, \"if what you wanted was \r\nto have him drunk, I'll admit that he is about the \r\ndrunkest man I have ever seen. I only spoke as I \r\ndid in order that I might spare your feelings, for \r\nmost wives object to seeing their husbands stagger \r\nand reel. I myself stagger and reel continually, and \r\nI have never tasted intoxicating liquor in my life, \r\nbut I can share the feelings of one who staggers and \r\nreels, or who has a relative that staggers and reels.\" \r\n\r\nAt this my wife said: \r\n\r\n\"Are you not Walsingham Gribbs? If you are I am \r\ndelighted to meet you, even in this unconventional \r\nmanner, for what brought us here will interest \r\nyou.\" \r\n\r\nShe then told him of the gyro-hat I had invented, \r\nand explained just why I had come to this place and, \r\nhad swallowed the strong brandy. I took no part \r\nin this conversation, but Walsingham gladly agreed \r\nto accompany us, and he put my gyro-hat on my \r\nhead. \r\n\r\nThe result was indeed marvelous. Instantly the \r\nvacuum pump began to work and the gyroscope to \r\nrevolve. My head, which had been lying on one \r\nside, straightened up. The rubber sweat band gripped my head tightly with a slight pulling sensation. \r\nWithout assistance I arose from my chair and stood \r\nerect. My brain was still confused, but I walked \r\nas straight as a string direct to the door of the \r\nrestaurant, and stood holding it open while my wife passed out with the ever staggering Walsingham. \r\n\r\nThe gyroscope was revolving at the rate of three \r\nthousand revolutions a minute, and the slight humming was hardly noticeable. I did not stagger and \r\nI did not reel. When I reached Gramercy Park I \r\nwas full of glee. I had been walking on the edge \r\nof the curb, but I now desired to climb atop of the \r\niron fence that surrounds the park, and walk on \r\nthe points of the pickets. \r\n\r\nMy wife and Walsingham tried to dissuade me, \r\nbut I climbed to the top of the fence. I not only \r\nwalked on the points of the pickets easily, but I was \r\nable to place the end of one toe on the point of one \r\npicket, and thus balanced, wave the other leg in the \r\nair. My wife and Walsingham Gribbs coaxed me \r\nto come down to the level of the walk, but as I saw \r\nno reason to do so, I flatly refused, and at last Walsingham reached up and took me by the hand and \r\npulled me. \r\n\r\nOrdinarily a man that had imbibed a quantity of \r\nbrandy would have fallen to the street if pulled by \r\none hand while standing on the top of a row of \r\npickets, but I did not. When Walsingham pulled \r\nmy hand I inclined gently toward him until I was \r\nat right angles to the picket fence, with my foot \r\nstill on top of the picket; and when he released my \r\nhand I slowly swung upright again, without any \r\neffort whatever on my part. I got down off that \r\nfence when I was ready, and not before. \r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt whatever that I was \r\nfar more intoxicated than Walsingham Gribbs, and \r\nall the way home I gave vent to tremendous bursts \r\nof laughter over the idea that while Walsingham \r\nthought he was seeing me safely home I walked as \r\nstraight and true as a general, and he staggered \r\nand reeled except when he clung closely to my arm. \r\n\r\nMany persons stopped and looked at us, and I \r\ncannot wonder at it. For Walsingham is a young \r\nman of most dignified countenance, and it must \r\nhave seemed strange to see a young man of such \r\nsober mien reeling drunkenly, while a dignified and \r\nsteadily walking hatter laughed and shouted drunkenly. It was as if the two of us had been able to \r\nafford but one spree, and had divided it in that way, \r\nhe taking the stagger and I taking the boisterousness. \r\n\r\nMy wife was much touched by the kind attentions of Walsingham, and when we reached home \r\nshe invited him in, and while I found a little harmless amusement in walking up the stair banisters \r\nand sliding down them standing on my feet, which \r\nI was enabled to do because of the steadying effect \r\nof the gyro-hat, she took Walsingham into the \r\nparlor and introduced him to Anne formally.

The relevant technique was called sperm electrophoresis, a ridiculously simple trick to perform in glassware - and the pharmaceutical manufacturers had quickly come up with a medium, an anion or cation exchange gel, which made it equally easy to perform in situ. Its purpose was sex determination of the child at conception. \r\n\r\nBy hindsight ... it ought to have been realized that the first several generations to have the trick made available to them would respond by \"starting with a boy.\" That preference had already existed, and indeed was so primitive that it might possibly be instinctual. The result,in any event, was the world of today, heavily overburdened with males, most of them useless - at least in the sense that neither the economy nor the society could find places for most of them. Being a man, Jom was inclined to think that the real death blow had been struck by the release of Selektrojel to the populace as an over-the-counteror non-prescription item. Possibly if its use bad been restricted to couples psychiatrically certified to need a baby of a given sex -- like, say, a couple to whom unaided nature had given only a string of five daughters, or, no, better make it nine ... But that would not have worked either. The demand for the stuff had been far too great.

Answer\u0097we take a lump of whatever material we need and cut away from it all the excess to leave the shape that we require. That forms the basis of just about every machining process that is used traditionally. Cut away what you don't want to leave behind what you do want.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay.\" The Assassin shrugged. \"What other way is there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Deposition!\" Brozlan peered at him intently as if expecting some violent reaction. The Assassin looked back at him blankly. Brozlan explained: \"Instead of cutting material away to leave the part, we deposited material to build the part up!\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean like electrolytic forming? That's not new.\"\r\n\r\n\"The idea isn't,\" Brozlan agreed. \"But the way we were doing it was. You see, electrolytic forming works only with certain metals. We were working with every kind of molecule.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean you could build up something out of anything\u0097any substance at all?\" The Assassin looked astounded.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly! And it didn't have to be all from the same kind of molecule, either. We could mix them together any way we chose.' For instance, we could produce a solid block that was phophor-bronze at one end and polythene at the other, with a smooth transition from one to the other in between. It opened up a whole new dimension in engineering design possibilities. The whole process was computer-controlled. A designer could develop a program to create any part he wanted out of any material he chose or any combination of materials\u0097molecule by molecule if he really wanted to go down to that level of detail and if he had the patience and the processor power to handle it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Molecule by molecule .. .\" The Assassin's face registered undisguised disbelief. \"That's incredible . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, it worked,\" Brozlan told him. \"There have been experimental plants on Mars operating for years now, turning out goods that are higher in quality and far cheaper to produce than anything' that could ever come out of the factories of Earth\u0097even things normally processed from organically derived substances, such as paper, oils, fats, sugars . . . you name it.\"",

It was analogous to the way in which an old TV camera encoded the information contained in a visual scene.\" Brozlan took a deep breath. \"The real breakthrough came when we combined Scheeman's technique with the molecular-deposition process that we have just been talking about!\"\r\n\r\nSilence reigned for a long tune while the Assassin digested the professor's words. Then his eyes widened slowly and transfixed Brozlan with a dumbfounded, unblinking stare.\r\n\r\n\"You're joking . . .\" the Assassin breathed at last.\r\n\r\n\"A solid-object camera!\" the colonel confirmed for him. \"Yes, Hadley, you've got it. They could scan an object and derive a complete structural code for it. From that code they could generate a computer program to control the deposition process.

Hauling up the drill, Endlich lowered an electric heating unit on a cable from an atomic power-cell, and then capped the casing pipe.\r\n\r\nYes, strangely enough there was still sufficient water beneath the surface of Vesta. Its parent planet, like the Earth, had had water in its crust, that could be tapped by means of wells. And so suddenly had Vesta been chilled in the cold of space at the time of the parent body's explosion, that this water had not had a chance to dissipate itself as vapor into the void, but had been frozen solid. The drying soil above it had formed a tough shell, which had protected the ice beneath from disappearance through sublimation...\r\n\r\nDrill down to it, melt it with heat, and it was water again, ready to be pumped and put to use.\r\n\r\nAnd water, by electrolysis, was also an easy source of oxygen to breathe.... The soil, once thawed over a few acres, would also yield considerable nitrogen and carbon dioxide\u0097the makings of many cubic meters of atmosphere.

Otherwise some slight \r\ndisturbance might have sent it off into space. \r\n<>\r\nA man, putting his full strength into a leap, could \r\neasily have torn himself from the face of the rocky little \r\nworld and hurled himself beyond its attraction. Thus the \r\nropes attached to the man and the ship. It would have \r\nbeen no joke to inadvertently hop off the tiny slab of \r\nrock and be unable to return. They had at first experimented with weighted shoes and then with magnetic plates \r\nattached to the soles, but both of these devices had proved \r\ncumbersome and awkward. ",

Then he sucked a great breath and let it out slowly.\r\n\r\nThe smoky globe, hung in the vault, was shot with colored light. The room had gone dim. Thousands of watts of floodlights struck the plastic surface and gleamed on the faces below as smoke in the bright sphere faded.\r\n\r\n\"What's going to happen?\" the Customs Officer asked. \"Is that where they wrestle . . . ?\"\r\n\r\nRydra brushed her hand over his mouth and he nearly swallowed his tongue: but was quiet.\r\n\r\nAnd the Silver Dragon came, wings working in the smoke, silver feathers like clashed blades, scales on the grand haunches shaking; she rippled her ten-foot body and squirmed in the antigravity field, green lips leering, silver lids batting over green orbs,. \"It's a woman!\" breathed the Customs Officer.\r\n\r\nAn appreciative tattoo of finger snapping scattered through the audience.\r\n\r\nSmoke rolled in the globe\u0097\"That's our Brass!\" whispered Calli.\r\n\r\n\u0097and Brass yawned and shook his head, ivory saber teeth glistening with spittle, muscles humped on shoulders and arms; brass claws unsheathed six inches from yellow plush paws. Bunched bands on his belly bent above them. The barbed tail beat on the globe's wall. His mane, sheared to prevent handholds, ran like water.\r\n\r\nCalli grabbed the Customs Officer's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Snap your fingers, man! That's our Brass!\"\r\n\r\nThe Customs Officer, who had never been able to, nearly broke his hand.\r\n\r\nThe globe flared red. The two pilots turned to one another across the sphere's diameter. Voices quieted. The Customs Officer glanced from the ceiling to the people around him. Every other face was up...\r\n\r\n\"What are they trying to do?\" the Customs Officer whispered. \"How can you tell who's winning?\" He looked down again: what he'd grabbed was Calli's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"When one can throw the other against the wall and only touch the far wall himself with one limb on the ricochet,\" Calli explained, not looking down, \"that's a fall.\"",

Gravel and granite silvered the broken edges. Behind was the city's red mist. Before, on broken night, rose the black Morgue.\r\n\r\nThey went down the steps and walked quietly through the stone park. The garden of water and rock was eerie in the dark. Nothing grew here.\r\n\r\nAt the door slabbed metal without external light blotted the darkness. \"How do you get in?\" the Officer asked, as they climbed the shallow steps.\r\n\r\nRydra lifted the Captain's pendant from her neck and placed it against a small disk. Something hummed, and light divided the entrance as the doors slid back. Rydra stepped through, the rest followed.\r\n\r\nCalli stared at the metallic vaults overhead. \"You know there's enough transport meat deep-frozen in this place to service a hundred stars and all their planets.\"\r\n\r\n\u0093As of yet, the Customs work involved in getting ships from star to star is a science. The transport work maneuvering through hyperstasis levels is still an art. In a hundred years they may both be sciences. Fine. But today a person who learns the rules of art well is a little rarer than the person who learns the rules of science. Also, there's a tradition involved. Transport people are used to dying and getting called back, working with dead men or live. This is still a little hard for Customs to take. Over here to the Suicides.\"\r\n\r\nThey left the main lobby for the labeled corridor that sloped up through the storage chamber. It emptied them onto a platform in an indirectly lighted room, racked up its hundred-foot height with glass cases; catwalked and laddered like a spider's den. In the coffins, dark shapes were rigid beneath frost shot glass.\r\n\r\n\"What I don't understand about this whole business,\" the Officer whispered, \"is the calling back. Can anybody who dies be made corporate again? You're right. Captain Wong, in Customs it's almost impolite to talk about things like . . . this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any suicide who discorporates through regular Morgue channels can be called back. But a violent death where the Morgue just retrieves the body afterwards, or the run of the mill senile ending that most of us hit at a hundred and fifty or so, then you're dead forever; although there, if you pass through regular channels, your brain pattern is recorded and your thinking ability can be tapped if anyone wants it, though your consciousness is gone wherever consciousness goes...\"\r\n\r\nRydra's hand came down on the crystal face, and the name glowed on the screen. \u0093Mollya Twa, Navigator-One.\" Her coordinate numbers followed.

One among hundreds of thousands of glass coffins was tracking from the wall above them on an inductor beam.\r\n\r\nThe recall-stage jutted up a pattern of lugs, the tips glowing. The coffin dropped, its contents obscured by streaks and hexagonal bursts of frost inside the glass. The lugs caught the tramplateon the coffin's base. It rocked a moment, settled, clicked.\r\n\r\nThe frost melted of a sudden, and the inside surface fogged, then ran with droplets. They stepped forward to see.\r\n\r\nDark band on dark. A movement beneath the glaring glass; then the glass parted, melting back from her deep, warm skin and beating, terrified eyes.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right,\" Calli said, touching her shoulder.

He\r\nswung it against the floor of the case that had held the\r\n'weapon' with a strident clang. \"There.\"\r\n\r\nRydra saw the circular indentation left by the hammerhead, Raised in the middle was the faint shape of\r\nthe Ver Dorco shield. She moved the tips of her\r\nfingers over the bossed metal, still warm from impact.\r\n\r\n\"No illusion,\" said the Baron. \"That crossbow will\r\nput a six inch shaft completely through three inches of\r\noak at forty yards.

Her fingers closed to grab it. But it was on\r\nthe standard again.\r\n\r\n\"No hocus-pocus. Merely selective and . . . obliging.\"\r\n\r\nHe touched the edge of the case and the plastic sides\r\nclosed over the display. \"A clever plaything. Let's\r\nlook at something else.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how does it work?\"\r\n\r\nVer Dorco smiled. \"We've managed to polarize\r\nalloys of the heavier elements so that they exist only on\r\ncertain perceptual matrices. Otherwise, they deflect-\r\nThat means that, besides visually\u0097and we can blank\r\nthat out as well\u0097it's undetectable. No weight, no volume; all it has is inertia. Which means simply by carrying it aboard any hyperstasis craft, you'll put its\r\ndrive controls out of commission. Two or three grams\r\nof this anywhere near the inertia-stasis system will\r\ncreate all sorts of unaccounted-for strain. That's its\r\nmajor function right there. Smuggle that on board the\r\nInvaders' ships and we can stop worrying about them.\r\nThe rest\u0097that's child's play. An unexpected property\r\nof polarized matter is tensile-memory.\" They moved\r\ntoward an archway Into the next room. \"Annealed in\r\nany shape for a time, and codified, the structure of that\r\nshape is retained down to the molecules. At any angle\r\nto the direction that the matter has been polarized in,\r\neach molecule has completely free movement. Just jar\r\nit, and it falls into that structure like a rubber figure\r\nreturning to shape.\" The Baron glanced back at the\r\ncase. \"Simple, really. There\"\u0097he motioned toward\r\nthe filing cabinets along the wall\u0097\"is the real weapon: approximately three thousand individual plans incorporating that little polarized chunk. The 'weapon' is the\r\nknowledge of what to do with what you have. In hand-\r\nto-hand combat, a six-inch length of vanadium wire can\r\nbe deadly. Inserted directly into the inner corner of the\r\neye, piercing diagonally across the frontal lobes, then\r\nbrought quickly down, it punctures the cerebellum.\r\n",

They were more airplane than spaceship, for, although each was sealed and pressurized to operate outside the atmosphere while making contact with orbiting spaceships, each was winged and was powered with ramjet atmosphere engines as well as with rocket jets. Like frogs, they were adapted to two media.\r\n\r\nA shuttle would be launched to catapult from the surface, her ramjets would take hold and she would climb on her wings, reaching in the thin, cold heights of the upper stratosphere speeds in excess of three thousand miles an hour. There, as her ramjets failed for want of air, her rocket jets would take over and kick her forward to orbiting speed of around twelve thousand miles an hour and permit her to match in with a spaceship.\r\n\r\nA nice maneuver!

Back on Earth there were ten or twelve billion hungry people looking toward it and licking their lips.\r\n\tThere was still a lot of argument about what comets were doing there, out in the cloud. It was still arguable about whether they even came in families. Then Oort came along to try to make sense of it. His idea was that there was this great shell of comets all the hell around the solar system, and every once in a while the sun would reach out and pluck one out, and it would come loping in to perihelion. Then we would have Halley's comet, or the one that was supposed to have been the Star of Bethlehem, or whatever. Then a bunch of the guys began kicking that around, asking why exactly that should happen. It turned out it couldn't-not if you assume Maxwellian distribution for the Oort cloud. In fact, if you assume normal distribution, you also have to assume that there isn't any Oort cloud in the first place. You can't get the observed nearly parabolic orbits out of an Oort cloud; so said R. A. Lyttleton. But then somebody else said, well, who says the distribution can't be non-Maxwellian? And so it proved. It's all lumpy...\r\n\r\nBut it was there. It gleamed faintly blue in the darkness punctuated by stars, strangely shaped. It was the size of an office building and more oblong than anything else. But one end was rounded, and one side seemed to have a long, curved slice taken out of it.",

He has concentrated \r\nin his instrument the light-gathering \r\nproperties of literally billions of infinitesimal photo-electric cells. \r\n\r\n\u0093He took a sheet of an electronegative \r\nalloy of his own contriving and, by a \r\nmost ingenious process, deposited upon \r\nit ultramicroscopic globules of silver, \r\neach so tiny that its diameter is less than \r\na single wave length of light. Silver is, \r\nof course, electropositive. Accordingly, \r\nwhen a beam of light falls upon this \r\nmosaic, a small electrical charge is built \r\nup on each of the countless little globules \r\nof deposited silver. Condensers store up \r\nthese charges, which are directly proportional to the intensity of the original \r\nlight beam, and the silver globule pattern thus formed represents an electrical \r\nimage of the source of illumination. \r\n\r\n\u0093An electronic scanning beam, so \r\nnarrow it covers only a single one of the \r\nultramicroscopic silver beads at a time, \r\nsweeps at tremendous speed over the \r\nmosaic. This has the effect of discharging the silver-alloy photo-electric cells \r\none by one, and releasing, simultaneously, the condenser charges. A current \r\npasses from the condenser, is stepped up \r\nand amplified enormously in like \r\nfashion, as in radio communication, and \r\na visual image is reproduced in the form \r\nof light waves by another electronic \r\nbeam and fluorescent screen. This \r\nmagnification alone had been set at ten \r\nthousand times. \r\n\r\n\u0093Think of it ! Add this increase to \r\nthe original magnification of the powerful 300-inch mirror on which the light \r\nfrom the distant stars has fallen, and \r\nyou have a total magnification which \r\nruns to an incredible figure.\u0094 \r\n",

In magnetized steel, if the bar is heated, the heat-motion of the molecules turns some of them around, with the result that the magnetism is lost.\r\n\r\nIn thermlectrium, even at low temperatures, the crystals turn, but they all turn together. The result is the same as though the bar had been inverted. A current is induced in the surrounding coil. And, of course, the energy which inverts the magnet, and drives the current of electricity, is the molecular motion known as heat. Heat was conquered!",

Ghostwheel  is  a-well,  it  started  out as a computer that\r\nrequired a different set of physical laws to operate than those I'd  learned\r\nin school. It involved what might be called magic. But I found a place where\r\nit  could  be built and operated, and I'd constructed it there. It was still\r\nprogramming itself when I'd left it. It seemed to have gone sentient, and  I\r\nthink  it  scared Random. He ordered me to go and turn it off. I didn't much\r\nlike the idea, but I departed.\r\n     I was followed in my passage through Shadow; I was harassed, threatened\r\nand even attacked. I was rescued from a fire by a  strange  lady  who  later\r\ndied  in  a  lake.  I  was  protected  from  vicious  beasts by a mysterious\r\nindividual and saved from a bizarre earthquake by the same person-who turned\r\nout to be Luke. He accompanied me to the final barrier, for a  confrontation\r\nwith  Ghostwheel. My creation was a bit irritated with me and banished us by\r\nmeans of a shadow-storm-a thing it is not fun  to  be  caught  in,  with  or\r\nwithout an umbrella. I delivered us from the vicissitudes by means of one of\r\nthe  Trumps  of  Doom,  as  I'd  dubbed  the  odd  pasteboards  from Julia's\r\napartment.",

And he and the girl beside him stood rooted.*\r\n\nThe Bolar current, popularly misnamed the paralyzing ray, has no effect whatever of a physical paralysis. It merely generates a sudden gravitational force, transitory, but of extreme intensity so that the victim stands momentarily \"rooted to the ground.\" The subject is highly technical of explanation. The affected material object does not gain an extreme weight, as in the case of an electronized gravity plate with full attractive force: the paralyzing beam acts more in the nature of magnetism - at the contact point of the affected object and the ground into which the Bolar current is discharged.",

Over the main entrance the words, CENTRAL LONDON HATCHERY AND CONDITIONING CENTRE, and, in a shield, the World State's motto, COMMUNITY, IDENTITY, STABILITY. The enormous room on the ground floor faced towards the north. Cold for all the summer beyond the panes, for all the tropical heat of the room itself, a harsh thin light glared through the windows, hungrily seeking some draped lay figure, some pallid shape of academic goose-flesh, but finding only the glass and nickel and bleakly shining porcelain of a laboratory. Wintriness responded to wintriness. The overalls of the workers were white, their hands gloved with a pale corpse-coloured rubber. The light was frozen, dead, a ghost. Only from the yellow barrels of the microscopes did it borrow a certain rich and living substance, lying along the polished tubes like butter, streak after luscious streak in long recession down the work tables. \"And this,\" said the Director opening the door, \"is the Fertilizing Room.\" Bent over their instruments, three hundred Fertilizers were plunged, as the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning entered the room, in the scarcely breathing silence, the absent-minded, soliloquizing hum or whistle, of absorbed concentration. A troop of newly arrived students, very young, pink and callow, followed nervously, rather abjectly, at the Director's heels. Each of them carried a notebook, in which, whenever the great man spoke, he desperately scribbled. Straight from the horse's mouth. It was a rare privilege. The D. H. C. for Central London always made a point of personally conducting his new students round the various departments. \"Just to give you a general idea,\" he would explain to them. For of course some sort of general idea they must have, if they were to do their work intelligently\u0096though as little of one, if they were to be good and happy members of society, as possible. For particulars, as every one knows, make for virture and happiness; generalities are intellectually necessary evils. Not philosophers but fretsawyers and stamp collectors compose the backbone of society. \"To-morrow,\" he would add, smiling at them with a slightly menacing geniality, \"you'll be settling down to serious work. You won't have time for generalities. Meanwhile \u0085\" Meanwhile, it was a privilege. Straight from the horse's mouth into the notebook. The boys scribbled like mad. Tall and rather thin but upright, the Director advanced into the room. He had a long chin and big rather prominent teeth, just covered, when he was not talking, by his full, floridly curved lips. Old, young? Thirty? Fifty? Fifty-five? It was hard to say. And anyhow the question didn't arise; in this year of stability, A. F. 632, it didn't occur to you to ask it. \"I shall begin at the beginning,\" said the D.H.C. and the more zealous students recorded his intention in their notebooks: Begin at the beginning. \"These,\" he waved his hand, \"are the incubators.\" And opening an insulated door he showed them racks upon racks of numbered test-tubes. \"The week's supply of ova. Kept,\" he explained, \"at blood heat; whereas the male gametes,\" and here he opened another door, \"they have to be kept at thirty-five instead of thirty-seven. Full blood heat sterilizes.\" Rams wrapped in theremogene beget no lambs. Still leaning against the incubators he gave them, while the pencils scurried illegibly across the pages, a brief description of the modern fertilizing process; spoke first, of course, of its surgical introduction\u0096\"the operation undergone voluntarily for the good of Society, not to mention the fact that it carries a bonus amounting to six months' salary\"; continued with some account of the technique for preserving the excised ovary alive and actively developing; passed on to a consideration of optimum temperature, salinity, viscosity; referred to the liquor in which the detached and ripened eggs were kept; and, leading his charges to the work tables, actually showed them how this liquor was drawn off from the test-tubes; how it was let out drop by drop onto the specially warmed slides of the microscopes; how the eggs which it contained were inspected for abnormalities, counted and transferred to a porous receptacle; how (and he now took them to watch the operation) this receptacle was immersed in a warm bouillon containing free-swimming spermatozoa\u0096at a minimum concentration of one hundred thousand per cubic centimetre, he insisted; and how, after ten minutes, the container was lifted out of the liquor and its contents re-examined; how, if any of the eggs remained unfertilized, it was again immersed, and, if necessary, yet again; how the fertilized ova went back to the incubators; where the Alphas and Betas remained until definitely bottled; while the Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons were brought out again, after only thirty-six hours, to undergo Bokanovsky's Process. \r\n\r\n\"Bokanovsky's Process,\" repeated the Director, and the students underlined the words in their little notebooks. One egg, one embryo, one adult-normality. But a bokanovskified egg will bud, will proliferate, will divide. From eight to ninety-six buds, and every bud will grow into a perfectly formed embryo, and every embryo into a full-sized adult. Making ninety-six human beings grow where only one grew before. Progress. \"Essentially,\" the D.H.C. concluded, \"bokanovskification consists of a series of arrests of development. We check the normal growth and, paradoxically enough, the egg responds by budding.\" Responds by budding. The pencils were busy. He pointed. On a very slowly moving band a rack-full of test-tubes was entering a large metal box, another, rack-full was emerging. Machinery faintly purred. It took eight minutes for the tubes to go through, he told them. Eight minutes of hard X-rays being about as much as an egg can stand. A few died; of the rest, the least susceptible divided into two; most put out four buds; some eight; all were returned to the incubators, where the buds began to develop; then, after two days, were suddenly chilled, chilled and checked. Two, four, eight, the buds in their turn budded; and having budded were dosed almost to death with alcohol; consequently burgeoned again and having budded\u0096bud out of bud out of bud\u0096were thereafter\u0096further arrest being generally fatal\u0096left to develop in peace. By which time the original egg was in a fair way to becoming anything from eight to ninety-six embryos\u0096 a prodigious improvement, you will agree, on nature. Identical twins\u0096but not in piddling twos and threes as in the old viviparous days, when an egg would sometimes accidentally divide; actually by dozens, by scores at a time.",

To Little Reuben's wink and snigger, this lecture was, of course, perfectly incomprehensible and, imagining that their child had suddenly gone mad, they sent for a doctor.

Sensory robot devices in their noses informed them that the waiting wheat had reached ripe perfection.\r\n\r\nAs they advanced, their heads swung lazily from side to side, very much like snakes, gobbling the yellow grain. In their throats, it was threshed, the chaff bundled and burped aside for pickup by the crawl trucks of a chemical corporation, the kernels quick-dried and blown along into the mighty chests of the machines. There the tireless mills ground the kernels to flour, which was instantly sifted, the bran packaged and dropped like the chaff for pickup.\r\n\n\n\n(Walking Mill from Bread Overhead!)\n\n\r\nA cluster of tanks which gave the metal serpents a decidedly humpbacked appearance added water, shortening, salt and other ingredients... The dough was at the same time with gas...\r\n\r\nThus instantly risen, the dough was clipped into loaves and shot into radiance ovens forming the midsections of the metal serpents.

The passengers had nearly all retired. A game was in progress in the smoking room, but the deck was almost deserted.\r\n\r\nSnap and I were passing along one of the interior corridors. The stateroom doors, with the illumined names of the passengers, were all closed. The metal grid of the floor echoed our footsteps. Snap was in advance of me. His body suddenly rose in the air. He went like a balloon to the ceiling, struck it gently, and all in a heap came floating down and landed on the floor!\r\n\r\n\"What in the infernal!--\"\r\n\r\nHe was laughing as he picked himself up. But it was a brief laugh. We knew what had happened: the artificial gravity-controls in the base of the ship, which by magnetic force gave us normality aboard, were being tampered with! For just this instant, this particular small section of this corridor had been cut off. The slight bulk of the Planetara, floating in space, had no appreciable gravity pull on Snap's body, and the impulse of his step as he came to the unmagnetized area of the corridor had thrown him to the ceiling. The area was normal now. Snap and I tested it gingerly.\r\n\r\nHe gripped me. \"That never went wrong by accident, Gregg! Someone down there--\"\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nWe rushed to the nearest descending ladder. In the deserted lower room the bank of dials stood neglected. A score of dials and switches were here, governing the magnetism of different areas of the ship. There should have been a night operator, but he was gone.",

Daneel Olivaw at Spacetown Approachway.\" He looked at his watch. \"I am a little early. May I request the announcement of my presence?\"\r\n\tHe felt more than a little cold inside. He was used, after a fashion, to the Earth-model robots. The Spacer models would be different. He had never met one, but there was nothing more common on Earth than the horrid whispered stories about the tremendous and formidable robots that worked in superhuman fashion on the far-off, glittering Outer Worlds. He found himself gritting his teeth...\r\n\tThe Spacer said, \"I shall introduce myself. I am R. Daneel Olivaw... I am a robot. Were you not told?\"\r\n\tThe robot's hand closed on his with a smoothly increasing pressure that reached a comfortably friendly peak, then declined. \"Yet I seem to detect disturbance. May I ask that you be frank with me? It is best to have as many relevant facts as possible in a relationship such as ours. And it is customary on my world for partners to call one another by the familiar name. I trust that that is not counter to your own customs.\"\r\n",

I'm a yeast-culture specialist.\"\r\n\"All right,\" said Baley.\r\nBut Clousarr went on, \"This laboratory keeps New York Yeast going. There isn't one day, not one damned hour, that we haven't got cultures of every strain of yeast in the company growing in our kettles. We check and adjust the food factor requirements. We make sure it's breeding true. We twist the genetics, start the new strains and weed them out, sort out their properties and mold them again.\r\n\"When New Yorkers started getting strawberries out of season a couple of years back, those weren't strawberries, fella. Those were a special high-sugar yeast culture with true-bred color and just a dash of flavor additive. It was developed right here in this room.",

They leave the Solar System under such tremendous accelerations that they approach the velocity of light in less than an hour. That means that the Overlords must possess some kind of propulsive system that acts equally on every atom of their ships, so that anything aboard won't be crushed instantly. I wonder why they employ such colossal accelerations, when they've got all space to play with and could take their time picking up speed?\r\n\r\nMy theory is that they can somehow tap the energy fields round the stars, and so have to do their starting and stopping while they're fairly close to a sun. But that's all by the way....\r\n\r\n\"The important fact was that I knew how far they had to travel, and therefore how long the journey took. NGS 549672 is forty light-years from Earth. The Overlords ships reach more than ninety-nine per cent of the speed of light, so the trip must last forty years of our time. Our time: that's the crux of the matter.\r\n\r\n\"Now as you may have beard, strange things happen as one approaches the speed of light. Time itself begins to flow at a different rate-to pass more slowly, so that what would be months on Earth would be no more than days on the ships of the Overlords. The effect is quite fundamental: it was discovered by the great Einstein more than a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n\"I have made calculations based on what we know about the Stardrive, and using the firmly-established results of Relativity theory. From the viewpoint of the passengers on one of the Overlord ships, the journey to NGS 549672 will last not more than two months-even though by Earth's reckoning forty years will have passed.",

Only once had he taken any direct action against a recalcitrant government.\r\n\r\nFor more than a hundred years, the Republic of South Africa had been the centre of social strife... When it became clear that no attempt would be made to end discrimination, Karellen gave his warning. It merely named a date and time-no more. There was apprehension, but little fear or panic, for no-one believed that the Overlords would take any violent or destructive action which would involve innocent and guilty alike.\r\n\r\nNor did they. All that happened was that as the sun passed the meridian at Cape Town-it went out. There remained visible merely a pale, purple ghost, giving no heat or light. Somehow, out in space, the light of the sun had been polarized by two crossed fields so that no radiation could pass. The area affected was five hundred kilometres across, and perfectly circular.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration lasted thirty minutes. It was sufficient: the next day the Government of South Africa announced that full civil rights would be restored to the white minority.",

In our own past, the use of power has been notably unsuccessful in solving anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"The operative word is correct. You have never possessed real power, or the knowledge necessary to apply it. As in all problems, there are efficient and inefficient approaches. Suppose, for example, that one of your nations, led by some fanatical ruler, tried to revolt against me. The highly inefficient answer to such a threat would be some billions of horsepower in the shape of atomic bombs. If I used enough bombs, the solution would be complete and final. It would also, as I remarked, be inefficient - even if it possessed no other defects.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the efficient solution?\"\r\n\r\n\"That requires about as much power as a small radio transmitter-and rather similar skills to operate. For it's the application of the power, not its amount, that matters. How long do you think Hitler's career as dictator of Germany would have lasted, if wherever he went a voice was talking quietly in his ear? Or if a steady musical note, loud enough to drown all other sounds and to prevent sleep, filled his brain night and day? Nothing brutal, you appreciate.

No other human has ever lived before and reasoned in such a condition. \r\n\r\n Ledo felt the sandtrout growth in, spreading itself over more and more of his hand, reaching up his arm. He located another, placed it over the first one. Contact ignited a frenzied squirming in the creatures. There celia locked and they became a single membrane which enclosed him to the elbow.

For seconds, nothing happened.\r\n\r\nThen pear-shaped, bumpy police battleships began springing out of nothingness around the jungle. Almost instantly, four cities raved into boiling clouds of gas.\r\n\r\nThe Dinwiddie pickup in the proxy backed itself hurriedly down the intensity scale until it could see again through the glare. The cities were still hanging there, seemingly stunned\u0097as was Amalfi, for he had not imagined that Earth could have come to such a pass. Only an ideal combination of guilt and savagery could have produced so murderous a response; but evidently the president and MacMillan made up between them the necessary combination \u0085\r\n\r\nClick.\r\n\r\n\u0093Fight!\u0094 the King\u0092s voice roared. \u0093Fight, you lunkheads! They\u0092re going to wipe us out! Fight!\u0094\r\n\r\nAnother city went up. The cops were using Bethe\u0301 blasters; the Dinwiddie circuit, stopped down to accommodate the hydrogen-helium explosions, could not pick up the pale guide beams of the weapons; it would have been decidedly difficult to follow the King\u0092s order effectively.\r\n\r\nBut the city of Buda-Pesht was already sweeping forward out of the head of the cone, arcing toward Earth. It spat murder back at the police ships, and actually caught one. The mass of incandescent, melting metal appeared as a dim blob in Amalfi\u0092s helmet, then faded out again. A few cities followed the King; then a larger number; and then, suddenly, a great wave.\r\n\r\nClick.\r\n\r\n\u0093MacMillan, stop them! I\u0092ll have you shot! They\u0092re going to invade\u0097\u0094\r\n\r\nNew police craft sprang into being every second. A haze gradually began to define the area of the Okie encampment: a planetary nebula of gas molecules, dust, and condensations of metal and water vapor. Through it the Bethe\u0301 guide beams played, just on the edge of visibility now, but the sun, too, was acting on the cloud, and the whole mass was beginning to re-radiate, casting a deepening luminous veil over the whole scene, about which the Dinwiddie circuit could do very little. The whole spectacle reminded Amalfi of NGC 1435 in Taurus, with exploding cities substituting novas for the Pleiades.\r\n\r\nBut there were more novas than the cities could account for, novas outside the cone of the encampment.

Even detecting that the object was present at all after it had been built was an almost impossible task, for neutrinos and anti-neutrinos have no mass and no charge, consisting instead partly of spin, partly of energy of translation; it did no good to try to visualize such particles since like all the fundamental particles they were entirely outside of experience in the macroscopic world.

The mower reached the edge of the lawn, clucked to itself like a contented hen, made a neat turn and trundled down another swath. The bag holding the clippings bulged.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the mower stopped and clicked excitedly. A panel in its side snapped open and a cranelike arm reached out. Grasping steel fingers fished around in the grass, came up triumphantly with a stone clutched tightly, dropped the stone into a small container, disappeared back into the panel again. The lawn mower gurgled, purred on again, following its swath.",

The helicopter drew closer, and he became certain that he was seeing the Barrier- the mysterious, impenetrable wall that divided the United States from the reservation known as Coventry...\r\nA tiny, bright dot appeared in the foot of the barrier opposite where they waited. It spread into a half circle across the lampblack nothingness. Now it was large enough for MacKinnon to see the countryside beyond through the arch it had formed. He peered eagerly.  ",

But if the ball spins as it rolls it will move in a curved line, the amount and direction of curve depending upon the amount and direction of spin.

At the rectangle's lower edge there gleamed on the smooth metal a score or  more of little circles of glowing light, of varying sizes, representing the suns of the edge of the galaxy behind us. Outermost of these glowed the light-disk that was our own sun, and around this Hurus Hol had drawn a shining line or circle lying more than four billion miles from our own sun, on the chart. He had computed that if the approaching dark star came closer than that to our sun its mightly gravitational attracction would inevitably draw the latter out with it into space; so the shining line represented, for us, the danger line.",

A ship floating in water can be propelled across the surface of the water by waves in it; then why should not matter likewise be propelled through space, through the ether, by means of artificially created vibrations in that ether, vibrations which can be produced with as high a frequency as the light-vibrations, and which thus propel the models through space at a speed equal to the speed of light itself.",

Like all paintings produced in Vermillion Sands at that time, it would not actually need the exercise of the painter's hand. Once the pigments had been selected, the photosensitive paint would produce an image of whatever still life or landscape it was exposed to. Although a lengthy process, requiring an exposure of four or five days, it had the immense advantage that there was no need for the subject's continuous presence. Given a few hours each day, the photosensitive pigments would anneal themselves into the contours of a likeness.\r\n\r\nThis discontinuity was responsible for the entire charm and magic of these paintings.  Instead of a mere photographic replica, the movements of the sitter produced a series of multiple projections, perhaps with the analytic forms of cubism, or, less severely, a pleasant impressionistic blurring. However, these unpredictable variations on the face and form of the sitter were often disconcerting in their perception of character.",

                    "excerpt": "Whereupon Webb, with a shrug of his shoulders, and slightly flattered withal,\r\nreturned to his space laboratory. This was famous throughout the system, and\r\nthe fruit of years of contriving. Webb Foster required absolute isolation and\r\nprofound peace for his researches into the origin of all things, into the fine\r\nstructure of space and time and matter. These desiderata could no longer be had on Earth, his native planet. \r\nEarth was a vast garden city with a population of ten billion humans...\r\n\r\nSo Webb Foster had built his space laboratory. It took five years and the\r\nunremitting labor of a thousand men. But when\r\n\fit was finished, the planets marveled, and his fellow scientists ached with possessive longing.\r\n It was a great crystal sphere, a thousand feet in diameter. The material was\r\nplani-glass, a transparent composition of Webb's invention. Its tensile strength\r\nwas that of fine-wrought steel, but its lightness greater than that of aluminium.\r\nIn its normal state it transmitted all the beating waves of space without let or\r\nhindrance; when polarized, however, only the wave lengths of light could slide\r\nalong the latticed crystals. Neither electricity, magnetism, X rays nor cosmic\r\nrays could force their lethal energies through the impenetrable barrier. A\r\nspecial repulsor screen, such as the space ships used, diverted plunging meteors\r\nfrom their destructive paths.\r\n Within the vast concavity Webb Foster set up his laboratory. All the normal\r\napparatus was there: huge dynamos powered by solar radiation, giant\r\nelectrostatic balls, flaring electron tubes high as a building, mass spectrographs,\r\na powerful photo-electric mosaic telescope, delicate immersion baths. \r\n\r\nBut besides this regular equipment were machines that Webb himself had\r\nfashioned: infinitely sensitive wave traps that tapped subspace itself, positron\r\nsegregators, where those flash-vanishing ephemera of nature could be held\r\nindefinitely; strange spiral whirligigs in whose light-approaching speeds time\r\nitself seemed to have lost its forward march--and a myriad other complexes of\r\nultra-science.\r\n Nor did Webb forget the more material bodily comforts. At the very center of\r\nhis space laboratory he placed his living quarters, wherein he studied and ate\r\nand slept and had his controls, like an alert spider at the core of his web. In his\r\nstorage compartments there was always a sufficient supply of dehydrated food\r\nfor three years of wandering, a thousand-gallon tank of water, and air-purifying\r\nmachines whereby the atmosphere could be indefinitely renewed and kept\r\nclean and wholesome. \r\n\r\nWHEN the great globe was completed, and stocked with all its multitudinous\r\nmachines, twenty rocket tugs towed it from its Earth hangar out into space, set\r\nit upon a previously calculated orbit a million miles beyond the Moon, gave it\r\nthe necessary orbital impetus, and set it free. Whereupon the space laboratory\r\nbecame a second satellite to Earth, revolving\r\n\fmajestically around the parent globe in uninhibited gravitational flight, rotating\r\nslowly on its own axis to generate an artificial gravitational field within.\r\n\r\n There, in the depths of space, flashing like a minor planet, the space\r\nlaboratory went its way, using no power in its interminable orbit, granting to its\r\nmaster that isolation, that abstraction from mundane noise and crowding which\r\nno longer existed on any of the inhabited worlds.

They were opening nerve endings and preparing bone. They were on the brink of a new world of the human and bionics, of joining living flesh and bone to electronics and steel and vitallium and plastic and tiny, powerful units of nuclear energy... Human and human-made were brought together, connected, spliced, wired, sealed...\r\n\r\n...As he slept they applied pressure to the soles of his bionics feet, and side pressures, twisting forces. They measured the flow of electrical energy from his brain down the intricate nerve networks... The boosted signal went down to intricate, articulated joits that could bend, twist, and flex... Small motors spinning with nuclear energy received the signal, and in their response sent greater energy into the joints.",

Neither bike had handlebars, but instead forward-mounted hydraulic assemblies of brushed steel, folded tightly. A cowling of black laminate armor enclosed the front. In place of a rider's saddle was a circular steel dome about a foot in diameter, its surface etched with mystical synbols. Nearly every ince of the bikes was covered in runes and glyphs and razor-sharp blades. They were as much fetish objects as machines. \r\n\r\nThe motorcycles rolled to a stop and twin hydraulic jacks slammed down onto the pavement like oversized kickstands or half formed legs. They thrust each bike nearly a foot off the ground, where they stood revving their 1800 cc engines deafeningly. Then twin robotic arms with gleaming three-foot sword blades unfolded from the forward hydraulic assemblies, lashing forth on gimabls, arcing smoothly with blinding spead as they ran through diagnostics like insects cleaning their antennae.\" Razorbacks are autonmous vehicles that can move between terror weapon and targeted assassination. Their primary armament are the two blades on the robot arms (which can swap out damaged blades like a fancy utility knife). They also have a blinding laser to disorient targets and make them easier prey. Finally, razorbacks have a battery powered 'stealth mode' that allows them to sneak up on targets. ",

That was a great metal cylinder, perhaps , ten feet through and twenty-five long, set up on end in the center of the dome building... \r\n\r\n\"... What is this thing? Well, it's an atom compacter. In plainer language, it digs holes...\"\r\n\r\n\"With it, if you liked, you could find many times its weight in gold. For with it you could sink shafts in a few hours to the deepest of metal deposits. Or you could build commercial tunnels at a rate of many miles a day. Or it could be used as a war Instrument: You could sink in it behind your own lines, burrow forward through solid earth till you were under the enemy capital, and there lay mines to be exploded when you were far on your way home again.\"\r\n\r\n\"It sounds to me as though you had invented a kind of metal earthworm,\" sniffed Ria...\r\n\r\nHe pressed at a section of the magnesium alloy beside a hairline oblong in the wall of the cylinder. A door appeared. Swiftly the three stepped inside the cylinder.\r\nInside, it was like the cabin of a submarine. There were a few padded bunks, a few chairs, also padded, and bolted to the metal floor. The rest was machinery and engines and tanks in a bewildering array.\r\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\"Hang on!\"\r\n\r\nHe pulled down the big, power switch.\r\n\r\nThere was a blinding arc as the\r\nswitch made contact. An angry\r\nscream sounded from the end of the\r\ncylinder on which they were resting. \r\nThe cylinder lurched wildly, then steadied.\r\nRia could feel motion. It was not rapid but it was distinct. They were going down, sinking.\r\nStreet gazed at Ogden with his grey eyes shining.\r\n \"Success so far, sir,\" he said, in an awed tone. \"The protective screen works, and we're settling down in the earth...\"\r\n\r\n\"We are sinking at a rate of about five miles an hour. John, explain it to her while I look over the controls.\"\r\nStreet pointed to the floor of the ten foot space, like a round room about them. Ria saw a quartz-glass trap door. She could see nothing but blackness through the glass, however,\r\n\"This floor is the upper part of a sort of false bottom,\" Street said. \"The real end of the cylinder is five feet farther down. Only there isn't any end that you. can see. The end seems to be open.\"\r\n\"Seems to be?\" Ria echoed.\r\n\"The real end of the cylinder, Ria,\" Street explained, \"is something invisible. It is a tremendously powerful rotating magnetic field. And it is the secret of the cylinder. That field, acting on substance before it, disrupts its atoms and then whirls the components to the rim of the field. There, the atoms are compacted and condensed. A cubic foot of rock, for ex- ample, is compacted to a cubic inch, but retains all its original weight, of course, in spite of its shrinkage. Look.\"\r\nHe switched on a light, which lit the space under the.glass trapdoor. Ria saw a whirling, furious mist, and, nearer to the glass, a sleek black wall, like black glass.\r\n\"The compacted matter, whirled to the rim of the hole the atom compacter is forcing for itself, is denser than any substance yet known and more than diamond hard. It makes a better tunnel lining than concrete, don't you think?\"",

The Hub, as it was more commonly known, made use of the bizarre discovery of quantum entanglement, which states that when one entangled particle is altered, the other particle in the pair is simultaneously altered as well, regardless of the distance that separates them. As each new communications component was created, so was a uniquely entangled system of particles. Half of the particles were placed inside the component\u0092s core while the other half was added as a new node within the Earth-based Hub. This clever arrangement enabled each starship, probe, mining platform, and colony to experience clear, real-time communication from anywhere within the Solar System. And with the advent of interstellar space travel, the transmission would continue uninterrupted from anywhere in the universe.",

You'd almost think it was real, Isidore observed as he headed back to the Van Ness Pet Hospital - that carefully misnamed little enterprise which barely existed in the tough, competitive world of false-animal repair...\r\n\r\nWhen he had parked his truck on the roof of the Van Ness Pet Hospital he quickly carried the plastic cage containing the inert false cat downstairs to Hannibal Stoat...\r\n\r\n\"What do you have there?\" Mr. Stoat asked.\r\n\r\n\"A cat with a short in its power supply,\" Isidore set the cage down...\r\n\r\n\"Why show it to me? Stoat demanded. \"Take it down the shop to Milt.\" However, reflexively, he opened the cage and tugged the false animal out. Once, he had been a repairman. A good one.",

But then, intelligence tests hadn't trapped an andy in years, not since the primordial, crude varieties of the 1970's.\r\n\r\nThe Nexus-6 android types, Rick reflected, surpassed several classes of human specials in terms of intelligence. In other words, androids equipped with the new Nexus-6 brain unit had from a sort of rough pragmatic standpoint evolved beyond a major - but inferior - segment of mankind... But new scales of achievement, for example the Voight-Kampf Empathy test, had emerged as criteria by which to judge. An android, no matter how gifted as to pure intellectual capacity, could make no sense out of the fusion which took place routinely among the followers of Mercerism - an experience which he, and virtually everyone else, including subnormal chickenheads, managed with no difficulty.\r\n\n",

A Spark Plug , as they were called, was a member of an elite group of men and women so gifted as to be completely expert in numerous fields of study - as many as five or six. Whereas most scientists and theoreticians were specialists, training their professional vision to ever narrower bands of the scientific spectrum, those like Adjani - and there were very few of them - worked in reverse, enlarging the scope of their knowledge wider and wider...\r\n\r\nMost often they were employed as systematicians - men who could view the overall course of a project and draw valuable information from other areas of study and bring it to bear upon a particular problem. They acted as catalysts of creativity - spark plugs - providing those quick, dynamic bursts of creative insight for projects that had grown too complex to rely on the accidental cross-pollinization of ideas from other disciplines.",

A palm lock must be keyed to one individual's hand shape and palm lines. But it looked like a palm lock. And there were ways to open any palm lock--as she had learned at school.\r\nJessica glanced back to make certain she was unobserved, placed her palm against the depression in the door.

The Rio treaties did allow one to withhold information temporarily - or try to - so long as careful records were maintained... never imagined that \"temporary\" might be interpreted to be as long as twenty years or that the registering of diaries like hers would become an industry in itself.\r\n\r\nTeresa sealed the file, swallowing the key in her mind.

                    "excerpt": "Acting upon the hint which had been conveyed from various investigations in the domain of physics, and concentrating upon the problem all those unmatched powers of intellect which distinguished him, the great inventor had succeeded in producing a little implement which one could carry in his hand, but which was more powerful than any battleship that ever floated. The details of its mechanism could not be easily explained, without the use of tedious technicalities and the employment of terms, diagrams and mathematical statements, all of which would lie outside the scope of this narrative. But the principle of the thing was simple enough. It was upon the great scientific doctrine, which we have since seen so completely and brilliantly developed, of the law of harmonic vibrations, extending from atoms and molecules at one end of the series up to worlds and suns at the other end, that Mr. Edison based his invention.\r\n\r\nEvery kind of substance has its own vibratory rhythm. That of iron differs from that of pine wood. The atoms of gold do not vibrate in the same time or through the same range as those of lead, and so on for all known substances, and all the chemical elements. So, on a larger scale, every massive body has its period of vibration. A great suspension bridge vibrates, under the impulse of forces that are applied to it, in long periods. No company of soldiers ever crosses such a bridge without breaking step. If they tramped together, and were followed by other companies keeping the same time with their feet, after a while the vibrations of the bridge would become so great and destructive that it would fall in pieces. So any structure, if its vibration rate is known, could easily be destroyed by a force applied to it in such a way that it should simply increase the swing of those vibrations up to the point of destruction.\r\n\r\nNow Mr. Edison had been able to ascertain the vibratory swing of many well-known substances, and to produce, by means of the instrument which he had contrived, pulsations in the ether which were completely under his control, and which could be made long or short, quick or slow, at his will. He could run through the whole gamut from the slow vibrations of sound in air up to the four hundred and twenty-five millions of millions of vibrations per second of the ultra red rays.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained an instrument of such power, it only remained to concentrate its energy upon a given object in order that the atoms composing that object should be set into violent undulation, sufficient to burst it asunder and to scatter its molecules broadcast. This the inventor effected by the simplest means in the world\u0097simply a parabolic reflector by which the destructive waves could be sent like a beam of light, but invisible, in any direction and focused upon any desired point.\r\n\r\nTesting the \"Disintegrator.\"\r\n\r\nI had the good fortune to be present when this powerful engine of destruction was submitted to its first test. We had gone upon the roof of Mr. Edison's laboratory and the inventor held the little instrument, with its attached mirror, in his hand. We looked about for some object on which to try its powers. On a bare limb of a tree not far away, for it was late in the Fall, sat a disconsolate crow.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said Mr. Edison, \"that will do.\" He touched a button at the side of the instrument and a soft, whirring noise was heard.\r\n\r\n\"Feathers,\" said Mr. Edison, \"have a vibration period of three hundred and eighty-six million per second.\"\r\n\r\nHe adjusted the index as he spoke. Then, through a sighting tube, he aimed at the bird.\r\n\r\n\"Now watch,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAnother soft whirr in the instrument, a momentary flash of light close around it, and, behold, the crow had turned from black to white!\r\n\r\n\"Its feathers are gone,\" said the inventor; \"they have been dissipated into their constituent atoms. Now, we will finish the crow.\"\r\n\r\nInstantly there was another adjustment of the index, another outshooting of vibratory force, a rapid up and down motion of the index to include a certain range of vibrations, and the crow itself was gone\u0097vanished in empty space! There was the bare twig on which a moment before it had stood. Behind, in the sky, was the white cloud against which its black form had been sharply outlined, but there was no more crow.\r\n\r\n\"That looks bad for the Martians, doesn't it?\" said the Wizard. \"I have ascertained the vibration rate of all the materials of which their war engines whose remains we have collected together are composed. They can be shattered into nothingness in the fraction of a second. Even if the vibration period were not known, it could quickly be hit upon by simply running through the gamut.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" cried one of the onlookers. \"We have met the Martians and they are ours.\"\r\n\n\n\n(From Spacewalk from Edison's Conquest of Mars)\n",

If I do not, there is a chance that we shall arrive at Mars with the ships half empty and the crews floating helplessly around us.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Edison's way of guarding against the danger was by contriving a little apparatus, modeled after that which was the governing force of the electrical ships themselves, and which, being enclosed in the air-tight suits, enabled their wearers to manipulate the electrical charge upon them in such a way that they could make excursions from the cars into open space like steam launches from a ship, going and returning at their will.\r\n\r\nThese little machines being rapidly manufactured, for Mr. Edison had a miniature laboratory aboard, were distributed about the squadron, and henceforth we had the pleasure of paying and receiving visits among the various members of the fleet.",

The letter enclosed a pamphlet that gave a more particular account of the E. A. H. B. G. than the circulars contained. My friend\u0092s invention was shaped in the likeness of the human figure, with body, head, arms, legs, hands and feet. It was clad in waterproof cloth, with a hood of the same to protect the head, and was shod with felt. The trunk contained the wheels and springs, and in the head was fixed the electric battery. The face, of bisque, was described as possessing \u0093a very natural and pleasing expression.\u0094\r\n     I opened the oblong box, where lay the automatons side by side, their hands placidly folded upon their waterproof breasts, and their eyes looking placidly expectant from under their waterproof hoods.\r\n      \u0093Now, which is Bridget, and which is Juliana \u0097 which the cook, and which the housemaid?\u0094\r\n      This distinction was made clear by dial-plates and indicators, set conspicuously between the shoulders, an opening being cut in the waterproof for that purpose. The housemaid\u0092s dial-plate was stamped around the circumference with the words: Bed, Broom, Duster, Door-bell, Dining-room Service, Parlor Service, etc. In like manner, the cook\u0092s dial-plate bore the words that pertained to her department...\r\n\r\n    At this point a wild shout of mingled exultation, amazement and terror arose from below, and we hastened down-stall\u0092s to find our son John hugging his elbows and capering frantically in front of the kitchen-door, where the electric cook was stirring empty nothing in a pan, with a zeal worthy a dozen eggs.\r\n      My eldest hopeful, impelled by that spirit of enterprise and audacity characteristic of nine-year-old boys, had ventured to experiment with the kitchen automaton, and by sheer accident had effected a working connection between the battery and the indicator, and the machine, in \u0093going off,\u0094 had given the boy a blow that made him feel, as he expressed it, \u0093like a funny-bone all over.\u0094\r\n      \u0093And served you right!\u0094 cried I. The thing was set for an hour and a half of work, according to the showing of the dial-plate, and no chance to stop it before I must leave for my office. Had the materials been supplied, we might have had breakfast; but, remembering the red-lettered \u0093Caution,\u0094 we dared not supply materials while that indefatigable spoon was gyrating in the empty pan. \r\n \u0093My dear,\u0094 I sighed, \u0093there\u0092s no way to stop it. We\u0092ll have to wait for the works to run down. I must call Harrison\u0092s attention to this defect. He ought to provide some sort of brake.\u0094\r\n      I now discovered that I was hungry. \u0093If that Fiend in the kitchen were only at work about something substantial, instead of whipping the air into imaginary omelettes!\u0094 I groaned.\r\n      \u0093Never mind,\u0094 said my wife; \u0093I\u0092ve a pot of coffee on the kerosene stove.\u0094\r\n      Bless her! She was worth a thousand Beneficent Geniuses, and so I told her.\r\n  ",

                    "link": "content.asp?Bnum=2711",
                    "excerpt": "The return mail brought me a reply stating that two Electric-Automatic Household Benefi\u00adcent Geniuses had been shipped me by express. The letter enclosed a pamphlet that gave a more particular account of the E. A. H. B. G. than the circulars contained. My friend\u0092s invention was shaped in the likeness of the human figure, with body, head, arms, legs, hands and feet. It was clad in waterproof cloth, with a hood of the same to protect the head, and was shod with felt. The trunk contained the wheels and springs, and in the head was fixed the electric battery. The face, of bisque, was described as possessing \u0093a very natural and pleasing expression.\u0094\r\n      Just at dusk an oblong box arrived by express and was duly delivered in our hall, but at my wife\u0092s urgent entreaty I consented not to unpack the machines until next day.\r\n      \u0093If we should not get the knack of managing them, they might give us trouble,\u0094 said this wise wife of mine.\r\n      I agreed to this, and having sent away Bridget with a week\u0092s wages, to the satisfaction of all parties, we went to bed in high hopes.\r\n      Early next morning we were astir.\r\n      \u0093My dear,\u0094 I said, \u0093do not give yourself the least concern about breakfast; I am determined that Harrison\u0092s invention shall have fair play.\u0094\r\n      \u0093Very well,\u0094 my wife assented: but she prudently administered bread and butter to her offspring.\r\n      I opened the oblong box, where lay the automatons side by side, their hands placidly folded upon their waterproof breasts, and their eyes looking placidly expectant from under their waterproof hoods.\r\n      I confess the sight gave me a shock. Anna Maria turned pale; the children hid their faces in her skirts.\r\n      \u0093Once out of the box,\u0094 I said to myself, \u0093and the horror will be over.\u0094\r\n      The machines stood on their feet admirably, but the horror was not materially lessened by this change of position. However, I assumed a bold front, and said, jocosely:\r\n      \u0093Now, which is Bridget, and which is Juliana \u0097 which the cook, and which the housemaid?\u0094\r\n      This distinction was made clear by dial-plates and indicators, set conspicuously between the shoulders, an opening being cut in the waterproof for that purpose. The housemaid\u0092s dial-plate was stamped around the circumference with the words: Bed, Broom, Duster, Door-bell, Dining-room Service, Parlor Service, etc. In like manner, the cook\u0092s dial-plate bore the words that pertained to her department. I gave myself first to \u0093setting\u0094 the housemaid, as being the simpler of the two.\r\n      \u0093Now, my dear,\u0094 said I, confidently, \u0093we shall see how this Juliana can make the beds.\u0094\r\n      I proceeded, according to the pamphlet\u0092s directions, to point the indicator to the word \u0093Bed.\u0094 Next, as there were three beds to be made, I pushed in three of the five little red points surrounding the word. Then I set the \u0093clock\u0094 connected with the indicator, for a thirty minutes\u0092 job, thinking it might take about ten minutes to a bed. I did not consult my wife, for women do not understand machinery, and any suggestion of hesitancy on my part would have demoralized her.\r\n      The last thing to be done was to connect the indicator with the battery, a simple enough performance in itself, but the pamphlet of directions gave a repeated and red-lettered \u0093Caution,\u0094 never to interfere with the machine while it was at work! I therefore issued the command, \u0093Non-combatants to the rear!\u0094 and was promptly obeyed.\r\n      What happened next I do not pretend to account for. By what subtle and mysterious action of electricity, by what unerring affinity, working through a marvellous mechanism, that Electric-Automatic Household Beneficent Genius, whom \u0097 or which, for short \u0097 we called Juliana, sought its appropriate task, is the inventor\u0092s secret. I don\u0092t undertake to explain, I merely narrate. With a \u0093click\u0094 the connection was made, and the new Juliana went upstairs at a brisk and business-like pace.\r\n      We followed in breathless amazement. In less than five minutes, bed number one was made, and in a twinkling the second was taken in hand, and number three also was fairly accomplished, long before the allotted thirty minutes had expired. By this time, familiarity had somewhat dulled that awe and wonder with which we had gaped upon the first performance, and I beheld a smile of hopeful satisfaction on my wife\u0092s anxious countenance.",

Then, very faintly, the noises of the night came again. There were sounds like those of organ-pipes, and very faint and apologetic noises like hiccoughs. All these sounds increased, and suddenly Huyghens could hear quite normally. As he watched, a side-port opened with a clattering, something unfolded from where it had been inset into the hull of the space-boat, and there was a metal passageway across the flame-heated space on which the boat stood.\r\nA man came out of the port. He reached back in and shook hands. Then he climbed down the ladder-rungs to the walkway, and marched above the steaming baked area, carrying a traveling bag. At the end of the walk he stepped to the ground, and moved hastily to the edge of the clearing. He waved to the space-boat. The walk-way folded briskly back up to the hull and vanished in it, and almost at once a flame exploded into being under the tail-fins. There were fresh clouds of monstrous, choking dust, a brightness like that of a sun, and noise past the possibility of endurance. Then the light rose swiftly through the dust-cloud, sprang higher, and climbed more swiftly still. When Huyghens' ears again permitted him to hear anything, there was only a diminishing mutter in the heavens and a faint bright speck of light ascending to the sky, swinging eastward as it rose to intercept the ship from which it had descended.",

This was the principle of the shell launched by the Zalinski pneumatic gun with which experiments had already been made at that epoch, but its results were multiplied at least a hundred-fold...\r\n\r\nIt is analogous to that of the Zalinski shell, but is a hundred times more powerful, and requires no machine for firing it, as it flies through the air on its own wings, so to speak.\u0094",

Light flickered on bits of ruby glass and on sensitive capillary hairs in the nylon-brushed nostrils of the creature that quivered gently, its eight legs spidered under it on rubber padded paws.\r\nNights when things got dull, which was every night, the men slid down the brass poles, and set the ticking combinations of the olfactory system of the hound and let loose rats in the fire house areaway.  Three seconds later the game was done, the rat caught half across the areaway, gripped in gentle paws while a four-inch hollow steel needle plunged down from the proboscis of the hound to inject massive jolts of morphine or procaine.

It did so slowly at first, so that one could only tell it was happening by the change in the way it overlapped the hexagonal structures that made up the floor. Those that were partially revealed beyond the edge of the ship's structure crept outward, and eventually tiles that had earlier been completely hidden began to show. All around the Proteus, the hexagonals emerged, and the rate of miniaturization accelerated until the ship was shrinking like a patch of ice on a warm surface. Carter had watched miniaturization a hundred times, but never with quite the effect upon himself that he was experiencing now. It was as though the ship was hurling down a long, infinitely long hole; falling in absolute silence and growing smaller and smaller as the distance increased to miles, to tens of miles, to hundreds... The ship was a white beetle now, resting upon the central hexagon immediately under the miniaturizer; resting upon the one red hexagon in the world of white ones--the Zero Module. The Proteus was still falling, still shrinking, and Carter, with an effort, raised his hand. The glow of the miniaturizer faded to a dull red and miniaturization stopped.",

I napped on the plane, too. I'm in good shape.\" \"Good, you'll have a chance to eat and shave and tend to other such matters if necessary.

Is it some kind of drug?\" \r\n\"Yes. Relatively new. It's not the sleep you need, you know. One doesn't rest in sleep to any greater extent than one would by stretching out comfortably with the eyes open. Less, maybe. It's the dreams we need. We've got to have dreaming time, otherwise cerebral coordination breaks down and you begin to have hallucinations and, eventually, death.\" \r\n\"The morphogen makes you dream? Is that it?\" \r\n\"Exactly. It knocks you out for half an hour of solid dreaming and then you're set for the day. Take my advice, though, and stay away from the stuff unless it's an emergency.\" \r\n\"Why? Does it leave you tired?\" \r\n\"No. Not particularly tired. It's just that the dreams are bad. The morphogen vacuums the mind; cleans out the mental garbage-pit accumulated during the day; and it's quite an experience. Don't do it. -But, I had no choice. That map had to be prepared and I spent all night at it.\"",

He won't miss me by over four feet, but he isn't swerving a hair. I think I'll block him off, just to see what he does.\"\r\n\r\nThe traveler paid no attention, did not alter its steady pace of a couple of miles per hour. It measured about twelve inches long over all; its paddle-wheel-like extremities were perhaps two inches wide and three inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think it's actually alive, sir? In a place like this?\"\r\n\r\n \"I'm sure of it. Watch carefully.\"\r\n\r\nIt struck the barrier and stopped. That is, its forward motion stopped, but its\r\nrolling did not. Its rate of revolution did not change; it either did not know or did not care that its drivers were slipping on the smooth, hard sand; that it could not climb the vertical metal plate; that it was not getting anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"What a brain!\" Northrop chortled, squatting down closer. \"Why doesn't it back up\r\nor turn around? It may be alive, but it certainly isn't very bright.\"\r\n\r\n     The creature, now in the shadow of the 'Troncist's helmet, slowed down abruptly -\r\n- went limp -- collapsed.\r\n     \"Get out of his light!\" Jack snapped, and pushed his friend violently away; and as\r\nthe vicious sunlight struck it, the native revived and began to revolve as vigorously as\r\nbefore. \"I've got a hunch. Sounds screwy -- never heard of such a thing -- but it acts like\r\nan energy-converter. Eats energy, raw and straight. No storage capacity -- on this world\r\nhe wouldn't need it -- a few more seconds in the shade would probably have killed him,\r\nbut there's no shade here. Therefore, he can't be dangerous.\"\r\n   \r\n  He reached out and touched the middle of the revolving shaft. Nothing happened.\r\nHe turned it at right angles to the plate. The thing rolled away in a straight line, perfectly\r\ncontented with the new direction. He recaptured it and stuck a test-prod lightly into the\r\nsand, just ahead of its shaft and just inside one paddle wheel. Around and around that\r\nslim wire the creature went: unable, it seemed, to escape from even such a simple trap;\r\nperfectly willing, it seemed, to spend all the rest of its life traversing that tiny circle.\r\n\r\n",

You haven't heard of it because it isn't in use yet; she must have ripped it off from the academy's special-activities lab.\" He sketched on a piece of paper. \"Time-binding is a function of the brain. It's a structuralization of perception and orientation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did it kill her?\" Buckman asked. It was late and his head hurt. He wished the day would end; he wished everyone and everything would go away. \"An overdose?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"We have no way of determining as yet what would constitute an overdose with KR-3. It's currently being tested on detainee volunteers at the San Bernardino forced-labor camp, but so far\" - Westerburg continued to sketch - \"anyhow, as I was explaining. Time-binding is a function of the brain and goes on as long as the brain is receiving input. Now, we know that the brain can't function if it can't bind space as well ... but as to why, we don't know yet. Probably it has to do with the instinct to stabilize reality in such a fashion that sequences can be ordered in terms of before-and-after - that would be time - and, more importantly, space-occupying, as with a three-dimensional object as compared to, say, a drawing of that object.\"\r\n\r\nWesterburg, refraining from sketching, said, \"A drug such as KR-3 breaks down the brain's ability to exclude one unit of space out of another. So here versus there is lost as the brain tries to handle perception. It can't tell if an object has gone away or if it's still there. When this occurs the brain can no longer exclude alternative spatial vectors. It opens up the entire range of spatial variation. The brain can no longer tell which objects exist and which are only latent, unspatial possibilities. So as a result, competing spatial corridors are opened, into which the garbled percept system enters, and a whole new universe appears to the brain to be in the process of creation.\"",

Deceleration followed and his feet left the floor. He squawked against his will.\r\n\r\nThe operator called out, \"Tuck your feet under the railing. Can't you read the sign?\"\r\n\r\nThe others had done so. They were smiling at him as he madly and vainly tried to clamber back down the wall. Their shoes pressed upward against the chromium of the railings that stretched across the floor in parallels set two feet apart. He had noticed those railings on entering and had ignored them.\r\n\r\nThen a hand reached out and pulled him down.\r\n\r\nHe gasped his thanks as the elevator came to a halt.",

To be sure, he had traveled previously only as far as Synnax's only satellite in order to get the data on the mechanics of meteor driftage which he needed for his dissertation, but space-travel was all one whether one travelled half a million miles, or as many light years.\r\n\r\nHe had steeled himself just a little for the Jump through hyper-space, a phenomenon one did not experience in simple interplanetary trips. The Jump remained, and would probably remain forever, the only practical method of travelling between the stars. Travel through ordinary space could proceed at no rate more rapid than that of ordinary light (a bit of scientific knowledge that belonged among the items known since the forgotten dawn of human history), and that would have meant years of travel between even the nearest of inhabited systems. Through hyper-space, that unimaginable region that was neither space nor time, matter nor energy, something nor nothing, one could traverse the length of the Galaxy in the interval between two neighboring instants of time.\r\n\r\nGaal had waited for the first of those Jumps with a little dread curled gently in his stomach, and it ended in nothing more than a trifling jar, a little internal kick which ceased an instant before he could be sure he had felt it. That was all.\r\n\r\nAnd after that, there was only the ship, large and glistening; the cool production of 12,000 years of Imperial progress; and himself, with his doctorate in mathematics freshly obtained and an invitation from the great Hari Seldon to come to Trantor and join the vast and somewhat mysterious Seldon Project.\r\n",

He had taken the instrument held out to him by Twer and was gripping the leather handle inside its leaden sheath.\r\n\r\n\"The instrument,\" he said, \"is dangerous, but so is a buzz saw. You just have to keep your fingers away.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as he spoke, he drew the muzzle-slit swiftly down the length of the steel sheet, which quietly and instantly fell in two.\r\n\r\nThere was a unanimous jump, and Mallow laughed. He picked up one of the halves and propped it against his knee, \"You can adjust the cutting-length accurately to a hundredth of an inch, and a two-inch sheet will slit down the middle as easily as this thing did. If you've got the thickness exactly judged, you can place steel on a wooden table, and split the metal without scratching the wood.\"\r\n\r\nAnd at each phrase, the nuclear shear moved and a gouged chunk of steel flew across the room.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" he said, \"is whittling - with steel.\"\r\n\r\nHe passed back the shear. \"Or else you have the plane. Do you want to decrease the thickness of a sheet, smooth out an irregularity, remove corrosion? Watch!\"\r\n\r\nThin, transparent foil flew off the other half of the original sheet in six-inch swaths, then eight-inch, then twelve.\r\n\r\n\"Or drills? It's all the same principle.\"\r\n\r\nThey were crowded around now. It might have been a sleight-of-hand show, a comer magician, a vaudeville act made into high-pressure salesmanship. Commdor Asper fingered scraps of steel. High officials of the government tiptoed over each other's shoulders, and whispered, while Mallow punched clean, beautiful round holes through an inch of hard steel at every touch of his nuclear drill.\r\n\r\n\"Just one more demonstration. Bring two short lengths of pipe, somebody.\"\r\n\r\nAn Honorable Chamberlain of something-or-other sprang to obedience in the general excitement and thought-absorption, and stained his hands like any laborer.\r\n\r\nMallow stood them upright and shaved the ends off with a single stroke of the shear, and then joined the pipes, fresh cut to fresh cut.\r\n\r\nAnd there was a single pipe! The new ends, with even atomic irregularities missing, formed one piece upon joining.\r\n\r\nMallow talked through and around his thoughts, \"Test that pipe! It's one piece.

We're going in on the Bottom Level, which is mainly storage, but we have hydroponic farms for our vegetables and carniculture plants for meat on the Second and Third Levels. That's counting down from the Main City Level. We make our own lumber, out of reeds harvested in the swamps after sunrise and converted to pulpwood, and we get some good hardwood from the native trees which only grow in four periods of two hundred hours a year. We only use that for\r\nfurniture, gunstocks, that sort of thing. And there are a couple of mining camps and smelters on the mainland; they employ about a thousand of our people.

They always call a news service a \"paper,\" especially when talking to other newsmen.\r\n\r\nOf course, there isn't any paper connected with it, except the pad the editor doodles on. What gets to the public is photoprint, out of a teleprinter. As small as our circulation is, we have four or five hundred of them in Port Sandor and around among the small settlements in the archipelago, and even on the mainland. Most of them are in bars and cafes and cigar stores and places like that, operated by a coin in a slot and leased by the proprietor, and some of the big hunter-ships like Joe Kivelson's Javelin and Nip Spazoni's Bulldog have them.\r\n\r\nBut long ago, back in the First Centuries, Pre-Atomic and Atomic Era, they were actually printed on paper, and the copies distributed and sold. They used printing presses as heavy as a spaceship's engines. That's why we still call ourselves the Press. Some of the old papers on Terra, like La Prensa in Buenos Aires, and the Melbourne Times, which used to be the London Times when there was still a London, were printed that way originally.",

                    "excerpt": "There now remained only the question of air; for allowing for the consumption of air by Barbicane, his two companions, and two dogs which he proposed taking with him, it was necessary to renew the air of the projectile. Now air consists principally of twenty-one parts of oxygen and seventy-nine of nitrogen. The lungs absorb the oxygen, which is indispensable for the support of life, and reject the nitrogen. The air expired loses nearly five per cent. of the former and contains nearly an equal volume of carbonic acid, produced by the combustion of the elements of the blood. In an air-tight enclosure, then, after a certain time, all the oxygen of the air will be replaced by the carbonic acid\u0097 a gas fatal to life. There were two things to be done then\u0097 first, to replace the absorbed oxygen; secondly, to destroy the expired carbonic acid; both easy enough to do, by means of chlorate of potassium and caustic potash. The former is a salt which appears under the form of white crystals; when raised to a temperature of 400 degrees it is transformed into chlorure of potassium, and the oxygen which it contains is entirely liberated. Now twenty-eight pounds of chlorate of potassium produces seven pounds of oxygen, or 2,400 litres\u0097 the quantity necessary for the travelers during twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nCaustic potash has a great affinity for carbonic acid; and it is sufficient to shake it in order for it to seize upon the acid and form bicarbonate of potassium. By these two means they would be enabled to restore to the vitiated air its life- supporting properties.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, however, to add that the experiments had hitherto been made in anima vili. Whatever its scientific accuracy was, they were at present ignorant how it would answer with human beings. The honor of putting it to the proof was energetically claimed by J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n\"Since I am not to go,\" said the brave artillerist, \"I may at least live for a week in the projectile.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been hard to refuse him; so they consented to his wish. A sufficient quantity of chlorate of potassium and of caustic potash was placed at his disposal, together with provisions for eight days. And having shaken hands with his friends, on the 12th of November, at six o'clock A.M., after strictly informing them not to open his prison before the 20th, at six o'clock P.M., he slid down the projectile, the plate of which was at once hermetically sealed. What did he do with himself during that week? They could get no information. The thickness of the walls of the projectile prevented any sound reaching from the inside to the outside. On the 20th of November, at six P.M. exactly, the plate was opened. The friends of J. T. Maston had been all along in a state of much anxiety; but they were promptly reassured on hearing a jolly voice shouting a boisterous hurrah.\r\n",

                    "excerpt": "During the eight months which were employed in the work of\r\nexcavation the preparatory works of the casting had been carried\r\non simultaneously with extreme rapidity.  A stranger arriving at\r\nStones Hill would have been surprised at the spectacle offered\r\nto his view.\r\n\r\nAt 600 yards from the well, and circularly arranged around it as\r\na central point, rose 1,200 reverberating ovens, each six feet\r\nin diameter, and separated from each other by an interval of\r\nthree feet.  The circumference occupied by these 1,200 ovens\r\npresented a length of two miles.  Being all constructed on the\r\nsame plan, each with its high quadrangular chimney, they\r\nproduced a most singular effect.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that on their third meeting the committee\r\nhad decided to use cast iron for the Columbiad, and in particular\r\nthe white description.  This metal, in fact, is the most\r\ntenacious, the most ductile, and the most malleable, and\r\nconsequently suitable for all moulding operations; and when\r\nsmelted with pit coal, is of superior quality for all\r\nengineering works requiring great resisting power, such as\r\ncannon, steam boilers, hydraulic presses, and the like.\r\n\r\nCast iron, however, if subjected to only one single fusion,\r\nis rarely sufficiently homogeneous; and it requires a second\r\nfusion completely to refine it by dispossessing it of its last\r\nearthly deposits.  So long before being forwarded to Tampa Town,\r\nthe iron ore, molten in the great furnaces of Coldspring, and\r\nbrought into contact with coal and silicium heated to a high\r\ntemperature, was carburized and transformed into cast iron.\r\nAfter this first operation, the metal was sent on to Stones Hill.\r\nThey had, however, to deal with 136,000,000 pounds of iron, a\r\nquantity far too costly to send by railway.  The cost of\r\ntransport would have been double that of material.  It appeared\r\npreferable to freight vessels at New York, and to load them with\r\nthe iron in bars.  This, however, required not less than sixty-\r\neight vessels of 1,000 tons, a veritable fleet, which, quitting\r\nNew York on the 3rd of May, on the 10th of the same month ascended\r\nthe Bay of Espiritu Santo, and discharged their cargoes, without\r\ndues, in the port at Tampa Town.  Thence the iron was transported\r\nby rail to Stones Hill, and about the middle of January this\r\nenormous mass of metal was delivered at its destination.\r\n\r\nIt will easily be understood that 1,200 furnaces were not too\r\nmany to melt simultaneously these 60,000 tons of iron.  Each of\r\nthese furnaces contained nearly 140,000 pounds weight of metal.\r\nThey were all built after the model of those which served for\r\nthe casting of the Rodman gun; they were trapezoidal in shape,\r\nwith a high elliptical arch.  These furnaces, constructed of\r\nfireproof brick, were especially adapted for burning pit coal,\r\nwith a flat bottom upon which the iron bars were laid.  This bottom,\r\ninclined at an angle of 25 degrees, allowed the metal to flow into\r\nthe receiving troughs; and the 1,200 converging trenches carried\r\nthe molten metal down to the central well.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The gas gave sufficient heat for the culinary apparatus, and the provision box furnished the elements of this first feast. \r\n\r\nThe breakfast began with three bowls of excellent soup, thanks to the liquefaction in hot water of those precious cakes of Liebig, prepared from the best parts of the ruminants of the Pampas. To the soup succeeded some beefsteaks, compressed by an hydraulic press, as tender and succulent as if brought straight from the kitchen of an English eating-house. Michel, who was imaginative, maintained that they were even \"red.\" \r\n\r\nPreserved vegetables (\"fresher than nature,\" said the amiable Michel) succeeded the dish of meat; and was followed by some cups of tea with bread and butter, after the American fashion. \r\n\r\nThe beverage was declared exquisite, and was due to the infusion of the choicest leaves, of which the emperor of Russia had given some chests for the benefit of the travelers. \r\n\r\nAnd lastly, to crown the repast, Ardan had brought out a fine bottle of Nuits, which was found \"by chance\" in the provision-box. The three friends drank to the union of the earth and her satellite. \r\n\r\nAnd, as if he had not already done enough for the generous wine which he had distilled on the slopes of Burgundy, the sun chose to be part of the party. At this moment the projectile emerged from the conical shadow cast by the terrestrial globe, and the rays of the radiant orb struck the lower disc of the projectile direct occasioned by the angle which the moon's orbit makes with that of the earth.\r\n",

It is nothing of the kind.  \r\n\r\nAll the stars\r\nexceed it in rapidity, and the earth herself is at this moment\r\ncarrying us round the sun at three times as rapid a rate, and\r\nyet she is a mere lounger on the way compared with many others\r\nof the planets!  And her velocity is constantly decreasing.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it not evident, then, I ask you, that there will some day appear\r\nvelocities far greater than these, of which light or electricity\r\nwill probably be the mechanical agent?",

                    "excerpt": "The projectile had now to be filled to the depth of three feet\r\nwith a bed of water, intended to support a water-tight wooden\r\ndisc, which worked easily within the walls of the projectile.\r\nIt was upon this kind of raft that the travelers were to take\r\ntheir place.  This body of water was divided by horizontal\r\npartitions, which the shock of the departure would have to break\r\nin succession.  Then each sheet of the water, from the lowest\r\nto the highest, running off into escape tubes toward the top of\r\nthe projectile, constituted a kind of spring; and the wooden\r\ndisc, supplied with extremely powerful plugs, could not strike\r\nthe lowest plate except after breaking successively the\r\ndifferent partitions.  Undoubtedly the travelers would still\r\nhave to encounter a violent recoil after the complete escapement\r\nof the water; but the first shock would be almost entirely\r\ndestroyed by this powerful spring.  The upper parts of the walls\r\nwere lined with a thick padding of leather, fastened upon springs\r\nof the best steel, behind which the escape tubes were completely\r\nconcealed; thus all imaginable precautions had been taken for\r\naverting the first shock; and if they did get crushed, they\r\nmust, as Michel Ardan said, be made of very bad materials.\r\n\n\n\n(19th century drawing of the projectile)\n\n\r\nThe entrance into this metallic tower was by a narrow aperture\r\ncontrived in the wall of the cone.  This was hermetically closed\r\nby a plate of aluminum, fastened internally by powerful\r\nscrew-pressure.  The travelers could therefore quit their prison\r\nat pleasure, as soon as they should reach the moon.\r\n\n\n\n(19th century drawing of projectile interior)\n\n\r\nLight and view were given by means of four thick lenticular\r\nglass scuttles, two pierced in the circular wall itself, the\r\nthird in the bottom, the fourth in the top.  These scuttles then\r\nwere protected against the shock of departure by plates let into\r\nsolid grooves, which could easily be opened outward by\r\nunscrewing them from the inside.  Reservoirs firmly fixed\r\ncontained water and the necessary provisions; and fire\r\nand light were procurable by means of gas, contained in a\r\nspecial reservoir under a pressure of several atmospheres.\r\nThey had only to turn a tap, and for six hours the gas would\r\nlight and warm this comfortable vehicle.\r\n\n\n\n(Diagram of the Verne projectile)\n\n\r\nThere now remained only the question of air; for allowing for\r\nthe consumption of air by Barbicane, his two companions, and two\r\ndogs which he proposed taking with him, it was necessary to\r\nrenew the air of the projectile.  Now air consists principally\r\nof twenty-one parts of oxygen and seventy-nine of nitrogen.\r\nThe lungs absorb the oxygen, which is indispensable for the support\r\nof life, and reject the nitrogen.  The air expired loses nearly\r\nfive per cent. of the former and contains nearly an equal volume\r\nof carbonic acid, produced by the combustion of the elements of\r\nthe blood.  In an air-tight enclosure, then, after a certain\r\ntime, all the oxygen of the air will be replaced by the carbonic\r\nacid-- a gas fatal to life.  There were two things to be done\r\nthen-- first, to replace the absorbed oxygen; secondly, to\r\ndestroy the expired carbonic acid; both easy enough to do, by\r\nmeans of chlorate of potassium and caustic potash.",

We may remember the scene of the meeting held at Tampa Town, in Florida, when Captain Nicholl came forward as Barbicane's enemy and Michel Ardan's adversary.  To Captain Nicholl's maintaining that the projectile would smash like glass, Michel replied that he would break their fall by means of rockets properly placed.\r\n\r\nThus, powerful fireworks, taking their starting-point from the base and bursting outside, could, by producing a recoil, check to a certain degree the projectile's speed.  These rockets were to burn in space, it is true; but oxygen would not fail them, for they could supply themselves with it, like the lunar volcanoes, the burning of which has never yet been stopped by the want of atmosphere round the moon.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had accordingly supplied himself with these fireworks, enclosed in little steel guns, which could be screwed on to the base of the projectile.  Inside, these guns were flush with the bottom; outside, they protruded about eighteen inches.  There were twenty of them.  An opening left in the disc allowed them to light the match with which each was provided.  All the effect was felt outside.  The burning mixture had already been rammed into each gun.  They had, then, nothing to do but raise the metallic buffers fixed in the base, and replace them by the guns, which fitted closely in their places.",

But how should they know when the projectile had reached this neutral point situated at that distance, especially when neither themselves, nor the objects enclosed in the projectile, would be any longer subject to the laws of weight?\r\n\r\nUp to this time, the travelers, while admitting that this action was constantly decreasing, had not yet become sensible to its total absence.\r\n\r\nBut that day, about eleven o'clock in the morning, Nicholl\r\nhaving accidentally let a glass slip from his hand, the glass, instead of falling, remained suspended in the air.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, \"that is rather an amusing piece of natural philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nAnd immediately divers other objects, firearms and bottles,\r\nabandoned to themselves, held themselves up as by enchantment.\r\nDiana too, placed in space by Michel, reproduced, but without any trick, the wonderful suspension practiced by Caston and Robert Houdin.  Indeed the dog did not seem to know that she was floating in air.\r\n\r\nThe three adventurous companions were surprised and stupefied, despite their scientific reasonings.  They felt themselves being carried into the domain of wonders! they felt that weight was really wanting to their bodies.  If they stretched out their arms, they did not attempt to fall.

But here reality, by the neutralizations of attractive forces, produced men in whom nothing had any weight, and who weighed nothing themselves.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Michel, taking a spring, left the floor and remained suspended in the air, like Murillo's monk of the _Cusine des Anges_.\r\n\r\nThe two friends joined him instantly, and all three formed a miraculous \"Ascension\" in the center of the projectile.\r\n\r\n\"Is it to be believed? is it probable? is it possible?\"\r\nexclaimed Michel; \"and yet it is so.",

Why?\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated before he answered, \"Quakes.\"\r\n\r\nQuakes. Earthquakes-moonquakes, I mean. I glanced at the curving walls sliding past and I wished I were in Des Moines. Nobody wants to be buried alive, but to have it happen in the Moon-why, you wouldn't stand a chance. No matter how quick they got to you, your lungs would be ruptured. No air.\r\n\"They don't happen very often,\" Knowles went on, \"but we have to be prepared. \r\n\r\nI nodded. \"I see. Since everything in the Moon has to be sealed airtight, you've got to watch out for quakes. These airlocks are to confine your losses.\" I started visualizing myself as one of the losses.\r\n\r\n\"Yes and no. The airlocks would limit an accident all right, if there was one-which there won't be, this place is safe. Primarily they let us work on a section of the tunnel at no pressure without disturbing the rest of it. But they are more than that; each one is a temporary expansion joint. You can tie a compact structure together and let it ride out a quake, but a thing as long as this tunnel has to give, or it\r\nwill spring a leak. A flexible seal is hard to accomplish in the Moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong with rubber?\" I demanded...\r\n\r\nKnowles sighed. \"...The volatiles that keep rubbers soft tend to boil away in vacuum and the stuff gets stiff. Same for the flexible plastics. When you expose them to low temperature as well they get brittle as eggshells.\"\r\n\r\n\"Show him a flexible joint,\" Knowles directed.\r\n\"Coming up.\" We paused half-way down the tunnel and Konski pointed to a ring segment that ran completely around the tubular tunnel. \"We put in a flex joint every hundred feet. It's glass cloth, gasketed onto the two steel sections it joins. Gives the tunnel a certain amount of springiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Glass cloth? To make an airtight seal?\" I objected.\r\n\r\n\"The cloth doesn't seal; it's for strength. You got ten layers of cloth, with a silicone grease spread between the layers. It gradually goes bad, from the outside in, but it'll hold five years or more before you have to put on another coat.\"",

His faint smile\r\nwidened. Within the small compass of\r\nthis simple-looking pellet was lodged a\r\ntiny mechanism, the most delicate and\r\nrevolutionary in the world. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, there was within it the power to see and register images. The development of that power had required years of heart-straining research and experimentation in photomechanics. His materials had included wires and screens of the most costly elements, as minute in their exquisite accuracy as they were gigantic in their conception.\r\n\r\nToo, he had employed nerve tissues of animals, treated to do things that they had never attained during their organic life. Included with this power was another - that of independent and almost limitless flight, occasioned by a diminutive motor that could receive and use at a distance the current from Dundonald's dynamos. The crystal ball was, in short, an eye. An eye that could not only see, but fly, roam, travel at speeds and in directions to suit its operator, transmitting its impressions across the intervening space.\r\nHe laid the bright particle beside the globe, then turned back a hinged portion of the stand's top. Underneath was a sort of keyboard, upon which he laid his hands as though to strike a chord upon a piano.\r\n\r\nA new vibration rose, more intense than that which had involved the houseful of motors. The little crystal ball stirred, then floated slowly upward like a bubble. Dundonald shifted his careful fingers on the keys, and the pellet paused, hanging motionless in mid-air a little higher than the scientist's head.\r\nDundonald bent and peered into the eyepieces. Immediately it was as if he saw himself from above. Tousled hair, furrowed brow, sharp nose half hidden by the twin tubes into which he gazed - again he smiled his triumph. The vision was as clear as the human eye itself.\r\n\r\nHe drew back and struck yet a third combination on the keys. The little mote that was his roving viewpoint sped out of the door like a winged diamond...\r\n\r\nBack he jerked to peer into the globe, his hands manipulating the keys.\r\n\n\n\n\n",

                    "excerpt": "He jerked back to reality as he entered the gigantic teardrop which was technically the Z9M9Z, socially the Directrix, and ordinarily GFHQ. She had been designed and built specifically to be Grand Fleet Headquarters, and nothing else. She bore no offensive armament, but since she had to protect the presiding geniuses of combat she had every possible defense.\r\n\r\nPort Admiral Haynes had learned a bitter lesson during the expedition to Helmuth's base. Long before that relatively small fleet got there he was sick to the core, realizing that fifty thousand vessels simply could not be controlled or maneuvered as a group. If that base had been capable of an offensive or even of a real defense, or if Boskone could have put their fleets into that star-cluster in time, the Patrol would have been defeated ignominiously; and Haynes, wise old tactician that he was, knew it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, immediately after the return from that \"triumphant\" venture, he gave orders to design and to build, at whatever cost, a flagship capable of directing efficiently a million combat units.\r\n\r\nThe \"tank\" (the minutely cubed model of the galaxy which is a necessary part of every pilot room) had grown and grown as it became evident that it must be the prime agency in Grand Fleet Operations. Finally, in this last rebuilding, the tank was seven hundred feet in diameter and eighty feet thick in the middle\"over seventeen million cubic feet of space in which more than two million tiny lights crawled hither and thither in helpless confusion. For, after the technicians and designers had put that tank into actual service, they had discovered that it was useless. No available mind had been able either to perceive the situation as a whole or to identify with certainty any light or group of lights needing correction; and as for linking up any particular light with its individual, blanket-proof communicator in time to issue orders in space- combat...!\r\n\r\nKinnison looked at the tank, then around the full circle of the million-plug board encircling it. He observed the horde of operators, each one trying frantically to do something. Next he shut his eyes, the better to perceive everything at once, and studied the problem for an hour.\r\n\r\n\"Attention, everybody!\" he thought then. \"Open all circuits\"do nothing at all for a while.\" He then called Haynes.\r\n\r\n\"I think we can clean this up if you'll send over some Simplex analyzers and a crew of technicians. Helmuth had a nice set-up on multiplex controls, and Jalte had some ideas, too. If we add them to this we may have something.\"\r\n\r\nAnd by the time Worsel arrived, they did.\r\n\r\n\"Red lights are fleets already in motion,\" Kinnison explained rapidly to the Velantian. \"Greens are fleets still at their bases. Ambers are the planets the reds took off from \"connected, you see, by Ryerson string-lights. The white star is us, the Directrix. That violet cross 'way over there is Jalte's planet, our first objective. The pink comets are our free planets, their tails showing their intrinsic velocities. Being so slow, they had to start long ago. The purple circle is the negasphere. It's on its way, too. You take that side, I'll take this. They were supposed to start from the edge of the twelfth sector. The idea was to make it a smooth, bowl- shaped sweep across the galaxy, converging upon the objective, but each of the system marshals apparently wants to run this war to suit himself. Look at that guy there, he's beating the gun by nine thousand parsecs. Watch me pin his ears back!\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed his Simplex at the red light which had so offendingly sprung into being. There was a whirring click and the number 449276 flashed above a board. An operator flicked a switch.\r\n\r\n\"Grand Fleet Operations!\" Kinnison's thought snapped across space. \"Why are you taking off without orders?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I... I'll give you the marshal, sir...\"\r\n\r\n\"No time! Tell your marshal that one more such break will put him in irons. Land at once! GFO off.\r\n\r\n\"With around a million fleets to handle we can't spend much time on any one,\" he thought at Worsel. \"But after we get them lined up and get our Rigellians broken in, it won't be so bad.\"...\r\n\r\n...And with the passage of time came order out of chaos. The red lights formed a gigantically sweeping, curving wall; its almost imperceptible forward crawl representing an actual velocity of almost a hundred parsecs an hour. Behind that wall blazed a sea of amber, threaded throughout with the brilliant filaments which were the Ryerson lights. Ahead of it lay a sparkling, almost solid blaze of green. Closer and closer the wall crept toward the bright white star.\r\n\r\nAnd in the \"reducer\" the standard, ten-foot tank in the lower well the entire spectacle was reproduced in miniature. It was plainer there, clearer and much more readily seen: but it was so crowded that details were indistinguishable.\r\n",

She shook her head, as if disapproving. \u0093Natural insolation averaged forty-five percent of Earth\u0092s, and with the soletta it\u0092s supposed to be up to fifty-four.\u0094 \r\n\r\n\u0093Tell me more about this soletta,\u0094 Sax said carefully. They told him in a kind of round. A group of transnationals, led by Subarashii, had built a circular slatted array of solar sail mirrors, placed between the sun and Mars and aligned to focus inward sunlight that would have just missed the planet. An annular support mirror, rotating in a polar orbit, reflected light back to the soletta to counterbalance the pressure of the sunlight, and that light was bounced back onto Mars as well. Both these mirror systems were truly huge compared to the early freighter sails Sax had enlisted to reflect light onto the surface, and the reflected light they were adding to the system was really significant. \r\n\r\n\u0093It must have cost a fortune to build them,\u0094 Sax murmured. \r\n\r\n\u0093Oh, it did. The big transnats are investing like you can\u0092t believe.\u0094 \r\n\r\n\u0093And they\u0092re not done yet,\u0094 Berkina said. \u0093They\u0092re planning to fly an aerial lens just a few hundred kilometers above the surface, and this lens will focus some of the incoming light from the soletta, until it heats the surface up to fantastic temperatures, like five thousand degrees\u0097\u0094 \r\n\r\n\u0093Five thousand!\u0094 \r\n\r\n\u0093Yes, I think that\u0092s what I heard. They plan to melt the sand and the regolith underneath, which will release all the volatiles into the atmosphere.\u0094 \r\n\r\n\u0093But what about the surface?\u0094 \r\n\r\n\u0093They plan to do it in remote areas.\u0094 \r\n\u0093In lines,\u0094 Claire said. \u0093So that they end up with ditches?\u0094 \r\n\r\n\u0093Canals,\u0094 Sax said. \u0093Yes, that\u0092s right.\u0094 They laughed. \u0093Glass-sided canals,\u0094 Sax said, troubled by the thought of all those volatiles. Carbon dioxide would be prominent among them, perhaps chief among them.",

All the fruits of the earth shall come to maturity at whatever season we think fit to choose, and increase a hundred fold more than they do at present; with innumerable other happy proposals.  The only inconvenience is, that none of these projects are yet brought to perfection; and in the mean time, the whole country lies miserably waste, the houses in ruins, and the people without food or clothes.\r\n\r\nIn a few days we came back to town; and his excellency, considering the bad character he had in the academy, would not go with me himself, but recommended me to a friend of his, to bear me company thither.\r\n\r\nThis academy is not an entire single building, but a continuation of several houses on both sides of a street, which growing waste, was purchased and applied to that use.\r\n\r\nI was received very kindly by the warden, and went for many days to the academy.\r\n\r\nThe first man I saw was of a meagre aspect, with sooty hands and face, his hair and beard long, ragged, and singed in several places.  His clothes, shirt, and skin, were all of the same colour.  He has been eight years upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers, which were to be put in phials hermetically sealed, and let out to warm the air in raw inclement summers.  He told me, he did not doubt, that, in eight years more, he should be able to supply the governor's gardens with sunshine, at a reasonable rate: but he complained that his stock was low, and entreated me to give him something as an encouragement to ingenuity, especially since this had been a very dear season for cucumbers.  I made him a small present, for my lord had furnished me with money on purpose, because he knew their practice of begging from all who go to see them.",

It was twenty feet square, placed in the middle of the room.  The superfices was composed of several bits of wood, about the bigness of a die, but some larger than others.  They were all linked together by slender wires.  These bits of wood were covered, on every square, with paper pasted on them; and on these papers were written all the words of their language, in their several moods, tenses, and declensions; but without any order.  The professor then desired me \u0093to observe; for he was going to set his engine at work.\u0094  The pupils, at his command, took each of them hold of an iron handle, whereof there were forty fixed round the edges of the frame; and giving them a sudden turn, the whole disposition of the words was entirely changed.  He then commanded six-and-thirty of the lads, to read the several lines softly, as they appeared upon the frame; and where they found three or four words together that might make part of a sentence, they dictated to the four remaining boys, who were scribes.  This work was repeated three or four times, and at every turn, the engine was so contrived, that the words shifted into new places, as the square bits of wood moved upside down.",

A squat metal sphere, painted in ragged patches of dun and olive drab. It had a single thick, pistoning, metal leg.\r\nThe bounding robot whipped that single metal leg around with dreadful unerring precision, like some nightmare one-legged pirate. It whacked its complex metal foot against the earth like a hustler's cue whacking a pooi ball, and it bounded off instantly, hard. The thing spent most of its time airborne, a splotchy cannonball spinning on its axis and kicking like a flea against the Texan earth. It was doing a good eighty klicks an hour. As it got closer she saw that its underside was studded with grilled sensors.\r\nIt gave a final leap and, God help her, a deft little somersault, and it landed on the earth with a brief hiss of sucked-up impact. Instantly, a skinny little gunmetal tripod flicked Out from beneath it, like a triple set of hinged switchblades.\r\nAnd there it sat, instantly gone as quiet as a coffee table, not ten meters away from them.\r\n\"All right,\" she said. \"What is that thing?\"\r\n\"It's a dope mule. From my friends in Matamoros.\"\r\n\"Oh, Jesus.\"\r\n\"Look,\" he said, \"relax. It's just a cheaper street version of Charlie, your car! Charlie's a smuggler's vehicle, and this is a smuggler's vehicle. It's just that instead of having two hundred smart spokes and driver's seats and roll bars like that big kick-ass car does, it's only got one spoke. One spoke, and a gyroscope inside, and a global positioning system.\" He shrugged. \"And some mega chip inside so it never runs into anything and no cop ever sees it.\"\r\n\"Oh,\" she groaned. \"Yeah, this is great, Alex.\"\r\n\"It'll carry, I dunno, maybe forty kilos merchandise. No big deal. Dope people have hundreds of these things now. They don't cost much to make, so it's like a toy for 'em.\r\n\"Why didn't you tell me about this?\"\r\n\"Are you kidding? Since when do I ask your permission to do anything?\" He walked up to the mule.\r\nShe hurried after him. \"You'd better not.\"\r\n\"Get away from there!\" he yelped. \"They're hot-wired.\" Jane jumped back warily, flinching, and Alex chuckled with pleasure. \"Tamperproof! Put in the wrong password, and the sucker explodes on the spot and destroys all the evidence! And what's more-if you're not, like, their friend? Or they're tired of dealing with you? Then sometimes they just booby-trap it, and blow you away the second you touch the keypad.\"\r\nHe laughed. \"Don't look so glum. That's all just legend, really. Doper brag talk. The dope vaqueros hardly ever blow anyone up. You and me both know the border doesn't mean anything anymore. There are no more borders. Just free and open markets!\" He chuckled merrily. \"They can send me whatever the hell they want. Dope, explosives, frozen human hearts, who cares? They're just another delivery service.\"\r\nAlex punched a long string of numbers, with exaggerated care, into a telephone keypad welded into the top of the mule. The robot mulled the matter over, then hissed open on a stainless-steel hinge, showing a big rubber 0-ring around its midsection.",

The shape of a huge ship began to come into view; rows of lighted windows, the occasional thrust of a lazy rocket blast.\r\n\r\nWith consummate skill the speedster slid alongside the huge craft...\r\n\r\nMagnetic grapnels shot out, drawing the two ships together.

She resembled him to some extent, except that she was exquisitely feminine, dark-haired, with a skin of warm ivory, while he was blond and ruddy. Her tinkling, silvery voice was troubled as she asked:\r\n\r\n\"Have I your leave to stay, Mich'l Ares?\"\r\n\r\nThe look of adoration he gave her was answer enough, but he answered with the conventional formula, \"It is given.\" He rose to his feet, walked right through the seemingly solid vision and made an adjustment on a bank of dials. Then he walked through the apparition again and, standing beside his chair, looked at her inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"You haven't forgotten, Mich'l, this is the day of the Referendum?\"\r\n\r\nMich'l smiled slightly. It would be a day of confusion in Subterranea if he should forget. As chief of the technies he was in direct charge of the tabulating machines that would, a few seconds after the vote, give the result in the matter of the opening of the Frozen Gate. But the girl's concern sobered him instantly. On the decision of the people at noon depended the life work of her father, Senator Mane. And it was now nine o'clock.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure they will order the Gate opened,\" he said instantly. \"All the technies are agreed that your father is right, that the Great Cold was only another, more severe ice age\u0097not the death of the Sun. The technies\u0097\"\r\n\r\nJust as the girl had seemingly materialized, a young man now stood beside her. In appearance he was a picture of pride, power, arrogance, and definite danger. His hawk-like, patrician features were smiling. This olive-skinned, dark young rival of Mich'l was Lane Mollon, son of Senator Mollon, ruthless administration leader and bitter opponent of Senator Mane's Exodus faction.\r\n\r\nLane looked at Mich'l insolently.\r\n\r\n\"Have I your leave to stay, Mich'l Ares?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"It is given,\" said Mich'l without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not calling on you of my own will, Mich'l,\" the apparition of young Mollon said contemptuously, \"but Nida had the telucid turned on as I stepped into the room.\"",

We must produce them periodically, too, so that by their force and their definite order of recurrence they would send a shock through vast distances, and compel the attention of dwellers on another sphere. Then they might respond with similar movements, which we could record on our magnetometers; and so we could start a conversation.\"\r\n\r\n\"See those telegraph poles?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are five hundred turns of that wire,\" his new guardian went on; \"and each turn is eighty-six miles in length.

The principle of it was simple: gravital radiation.\r\n\r\nGranton had never been able to understand why gravitation had always been called a \"pull\"; every phenomenon known concerning the force of gravity would fit as well into the framework of a repulsive theory. He had gone on that principle: that gravity is not a pull, but a pressure pervading all space. The Granton motor was attuned to the matter-radiations of the earth, and it was insulated against the influences of the other worlds of space. It acted as a super-transformer unit, infinitely sensitive in its receiving cells to the pressure of the earth; the result was tremendous propulsive power. In operation tests it proved to be nearly ninety-nine percent efficient - as close to perfect as any manbuilt mechanism could come; harnessed to a space ship, it would be just about the ideal thing for interplanetary travel.",

What they do is use a field somewhat similar to the field we use in making cosmium, except that in theirs, instead of the photons lying side by side, they slide into one another, compounding. They evidently get three photons to go into one. Now, as we know, that size photon doesn't exist for the excellent reason that it can't in this space. Space closes in about it. Therefore they have a projected field to accompany it that tends to open out space - and they are using that, not the attractive ray, on us now. The result is that for a distnce  not too great, the triple-ray exists in normal space - then goes into another. Now the question is how can we stop it? I have no idea - have you any?\"\r\n\"Yes, but my idea can't exist in this space either,\" grinned Morey.",

A rough cylinder, about fifty kilometers in length and 20 in diameter, it rotated on its long axis in a bit over ten hours; and at that epoch when humans arrived, that axis happened to be almost normal to the orbital plane. Those who settled on Wunderland paid it no attention; they had a habitable planet. The Belters who came later, from the asteroids of the Solar System, realized what a treasure was theirs. Little work was needed to make the cylinder smooth, control precession, and give it a centrifugal acceleration of one g at the circumference. With its axial orientation, the velocity changes for spacecraft to dock were minimal, and magnetic anchors easily held them fast until they were ready to depart. The excavation of rooms and passages in the yielding material went rapidly. Thereafter, spaces just under the surface provided Earth-weight for such activities as required it, including the bringing of babies to term; farther inward were the levels of successively lower weight, where Belters felt comfortable and where other undertakings were possible.\r\nEverywhere around orbited members of the Swarm, their mineral wealth held in negligible gravity wells. Tiamat boomed. It became an industrial center, devoted especially to the production of things associated with spacefaring.\r\nWhen the kzinti invaded, they were quick to realize its importance. Their introduction of the gravity polarizer changed many of the manufacturing programs, but scarcely affected Tiamat itself; one seldom had any reason to adjust the field in a given section, since one could have whatever weight was desired simply by going to the appropriate level.",

We certainly rode around the station on ours. They consisted of one hollow tube, sliding inside another. The two were connected by a powerful spring, one tube ending in a hook, the other in a wide rubber pad. That was all there was to it. If you wanted to move, you put the pad against the nearest wall and shoved. The recoil launched you into space, and when you arrived at your destination you let the spring absorb your velocity and bring you to rest. Trying to stop yourself with your bare hands was liable to result in sprained wrists.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't quite as easy as it sounds, though, for if you weren't careful you could bounce right back the way you'd come.",

Clamped to the walls around us were \r\nthe space suits, and I looked at them longingly. It had \r\nalways been one of my ambitions to wear one and to \r\nbecome a tiny, self-contained world of my own...\r\n\r\nTo most people, the word \"space suit\" conjures up a \r\npicture of something like a diving dress, in which a \r\nman can walk and use his arms. Such suits are, of \r\ncourse, used on places like the moon. But on a space \r\nstation, where there's no gravity, your legs aren't much \r\nuse anyway, because outside you have to blow yourself round with tiny rocket units. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, the lower part of the suit was simply \r\na rigid cylinder. When I climbed inside it, I found that \r\nI could use my feet only to work some control pedals, \r\nwhich I was careful not to touch. There was a little \r\nseat, and a transparent dome covering the top of the \r\ncylinder gave me good visibility. I could use my hands \r\nand arms. Just below my chin there was a neat little \r\ncontrol panel with a tiny keyboard and a few meters. \r\nIf I wanted to handle anything outside, there were \r\nflexible sleeves through which I could push my arms. \r\nThey ended in gloves which, although they seemed \r\nclumsy, enabled one to carry out quite delicate operations. \r\n\r\nTim threw some of the switches on my suit and \r\nclamped the transparent dome over my head. I felt \r\nrather like being inside a coffin with a view.\r\n\n\n\n(Islands in the Sky)\n\n",

                    "excerpt": "Then came again that rolling noise like thunder which had awakened me out of torpor. \"I begin to understand,\" I said to myself after some little time devoted to reflection; \"it is not through the solid mass that the sound reaches my ears. The walls of my cavernous retreat are of solid granite, and the most fearful explosion would not make uproar enough to penetrate them. The place I was in must possess some peculiar acoustic properties of its own.\" Again I listened; and this time-yes, this time-I heard my name distinctly pronounced; cast as it were into space. It was my uncle the Professor who was speaking. He was in conversation with the guide, and the word which had so often reached my ears, forlorad, was a Danish expression. Then I understood it all. In order to make myself heard, I too must speak as it were along the side of the gallery, which would carry the sound of my voice just as the wire carries the electric fluid from point to point. But there was no time to lose. If my companions were only to remove a few feet from where they stood, the acoustic effect would be over, my Whispering Gallery destroyed. I again therefore crawled towards the wall and said as clearly and distinctly as I could- \"Uncle Hardwigg.\" I then awaited a reply. Sound does not possess the property of travelling with such extreme rapidity. Besides, the density of the air at that depth from light and motion, was very far from adding to the rapidity of the circulation. Several seconds elapsed, which to my excited imagination, appeared ages; and these words reached my eager ears, and moved my wildly beating heart- \"Harry, my boy, is that you?\" \r\nA short delay between question and answer. \"Yes-yes.\" \r\n\"Where are you?\" \"Lost!\" \"And your lamp?\" \"Out.\" \"But the guiding stream?\" \"Is lost!\" \"Keep your courage, Harry. We will do our best.\" \"One moment, my uncle,\" I cried; \"I have no longer strength to answer your questions. But-for heaven's sake-do you-continue-to speak-to me!\" Absolute silence I felt, would be annihilation. ... This apparently astounding acoustic mystery is easily explainable by simple natural laws; it arose from the peculiar formation of the gallery and from the conductibility of the rock. There are many instances of this singular propagation of sound which are not perceptible in its less mediate positions. In the interior galley of St. Paul's, and amid the curious caverns in Sicily, these phenomena are observable. The most marvellous of them all is known as the Ear of Dionysius.",

Subsequent generations might perhaps be modified so as to withstand even the sub-arctic and \"temperate\" climates. Oxygen was plentiful, but it was all tied up in chemical combination. Inevitably so, since oxygen combines very readily, and on Venus there was no vegetable life to exhale the free gas and replenish the ever-vanishing supply. It was necessary, then, to equip Venus with an appropriate vegetation, which in the course of ages should render the planet's atmosphere hospitable to man.",

Your name is Rogers, is it not? Very well, Rogers, you are a space-time event having duration four ways. You are not quite six feet tall, you are about twenty inches wide and perhaps ten inches thick. In time, there stretches behind you more of this space-time event, reaching to perhaps nineteen-sixteen, of which we see a cross-section here at right angles to the time axis, and as thick as the present. At the far end is a baby, smelling of sour milk and drooling its breakfast on its bib. At the other end lies, perhaps, an old man someplace in the nineteen-eighties.\r\n\r\n\"Imagine this space-time event that we call Rogers as a long pink worm, continuous through the years, one end in his mother's womb, and the other at the grave...\"\r\n\r\n\"Now think of our long pink worm as a conductor of electricity. You have heard, perhaps, of the fact that electrical engineers can, by certain measurements, predict the exact location of a break in a trans-Atlantic cable without ever leaving the shore.

As far as I know, no court has yet determined whether these gait-cams are any more legal, but until they do, we're stuck with them.\r\n\r\n\"Gait\" is a fancy word for the way you walk. People are pretty good at spotting gaits...\r\n\r\nGait-recognition software takes pictures of your motion, tries to isolate you in the pics as a silhouette, and then tries to match the silhouette to a database to see if it knows who you are. It's a biometric identifier, like finger prints or retina-scans, but it's got a lot more \"collisions\" than either of those. A biometric \"collision\" is when a measurement matches more than one person...\r\n\r\n...I prefer to inject a little randomness into my attacks on gait-recognition; I put a handful of gravel into each shoe. Cheap and effective, and no two steps are the same.\r\n\r\nThe cameras used to set off an alert every time someone they didn't recognize stepped onto campus...\r\n\r\n...now it just tries to keep track of who's where, when. If someone leaves by the school gates during classes, their gait is checked to see if it sorta-kinda matches any student gait and if it does, whoop-whoop-whoop, ring the alarm!",

In the United States there was not, after the beginning of the last quarter of the century, any opportunity whatever for individual enterprise in any important field of industry, unless backed by a great capital. During the last decade of the century, such small businesses as still remained were fast-failing survivals of a past epoch, or mere parasites on the great corporations, or else existed in fields too small to attract the great capitalists. Small businesses, as far as they still remained, were reduced to the condition of rats and mice, living in holes and corners, and counting on evading notice for the enjoyment of existence. The railroads had gone on combining till a few great syndicates controlled every rail in the land. In manufactories, every important staple was controlled by a syndicate. These syndicates, pools, trusts, or whatever their name, fixed prices and crushed all competition except when combinations as vast as themselves arose. Then a struggle, resulting in a still greater consolidation, ensued. The great city bazar crushed it country rivals with branch stores, and in the city itself absorbed its smaller rivals till the business of a whole quarter was concentrated under one roof, with a hundred former proprietors of shops serving as clerks. Having no business of his own to put his money in, the small capitalist, at the same time that he took service under the corporation, found no other investment for his money but its stocks and bonds, thus becoming doubly dependent upon it.",

                    "excerpt": "\"Come, then, into the music room,\" she said, and I followed\r\nher into an apartment finished, without hangings, in wood, with\r\na floor of polished wood. I was prepared for new devices in musical\r\ninstruments, but I saw nothing in the room which by any\r\nstretch of imagination could be conceived as such. It was evident\r\nthat my puzzled appearance was affording intense amusement to\r\nEdith.\r\n\r\n\"Please look at to-day's music,\" she said, handing me a card,\r\n\"and tell me what you would prefer. It is now five o'clock, you\r\nwill remember.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe card bore the date \"September 12, 2000,\" and contained\r\nthe longest programme of music I had ever seen. It was as\r\nvarious as it was long, including a most extraordinary range of\r\nvocal and instrumental solos, duets, quartettes, and various\r\norchestral combinations. I remained bewildered by the prodigious\r\nlist until Edith's pink finger tip indicated a particular\r\nsection of it, where several selections were bracketed, with the\r\nwords \"5 P.M.\" against them; then I observed that this prodigious\r\nprogramme was an all-day one, divided into twenty-four sections\r\nanswering to the hours. There were but a few pieces of music in\r\nthe \"5 P.M.\" section, and I indicated an organ piece as my\r\npreference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am so glad you like the organ,\" said she. \"I think there is\r\nscarcely any music that suits my mood oftener.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShe made me sit down comfortably, and, crossing the room, so\r\nfar as I could see, merely touched one or two screws, and at once\r\nthe room was filled with the music of a grand organ anthem;\r\nfilled, not flooded, for, by some means, the volume of melody\r\nhad been perfectly graduated to the size of the apartment. I\r\nlistened, scarcely breathing, to the close. Such music, so perfectly\r\nrendered, I had never expected to hear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Grand!\" I cried, as the last great wave of sound broke and\r\nebbed away into silence. \"Bach must be at the keys of that\r\norgan; but where is the organ?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment, please,\" said Edith; \"I want to have you\r\nlisten to this waltz before you ask any questions. I think it is\r\nperfectly charming\"; and as she spoke the sound of violins filled\r\nthe room with the witchery of a summer night. When this had\r\nalso ceased, she said: \"There is nothing in the least mysterious\r\nabout the music, as you seem to imagine. It is not made by\r\nfairies or genii, but by good, honest, and exceedingly clever\r\nhuman hands. We have simply carried the idea of labor saving\r\nby cooperation into our musical service as into everything else.\r\nThere are a number of music rooms in the city, perfectly\r\nadapted acoustically to the different sorts of music. These halls\r\nare connected by telephone with all the houses of the city whose\r\npeople care to pay the small fee, and there are none, you may be\r\nsure, who do not. The corps of musicians attached to each hall is\r\nso large that, although no individual performer, or group of\r\nperformers, has more than a brief part, each day's programme\r\nlasts through the twenty-four hours. There are on that card for\r\nto-day, as you will see if you observe closely, distinct programmes\r\nof four of these concerts, each of a different order of music from\r\nthe others, being now simultaneously performed, and any one of\r\nthe four pieces now going on that you prefer, you can hear by\r\nmerely pressing the button which will connect your house-wire\r\nwith the hall where it is being rendered. The programmes are so\r\ncoordinated that the pieces at any one time simultaneously\r\nproceeding in the different halls usually offer a choice, not only\r\nbetween instrumental and vocal, and between different sorts of\r\ninstruments; but also between different motives from grave to\r\ngay, so that all tastes and moods can be suited.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It appears to me, Miss Leete,\" I said, \"that if we could have\r\ndevised an arrangement for providing everybody with music in\r\ntheir homes, perfect in quality, unlimited in quantity, suited to\r\nevery mood, and beginning and ceasing at will, we should have\r\nconsidered the limit of human felicity already attained, and\r\nceased to strive for further improvements.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I never could imagine how those among you who\r\ndepended at all on music managed to endure the old-fashioned\r\nsystem for providing it,\" replied Edith. \"Music really worth\r\nhearing must have been, I suppose, wholly out of the reach of\r\nthe masses, and attainable by the most favored only occasionally,\r\nat great trouble, prodigious expense, and then for brief periods,\r\narbitrarily fixed by somebody else, and in connection with all\r\nsorts of undesirable circumstances. Your concerts, for instance,\r\nand operas! How perfectly exasperating it must have been, for\r\nthe sake of a piece or two of music that suited you, to have to sit\r\nfor hours listening to what you did not care for! Now, at a\r\ndinner one can skip the courses one does not care for. Who\r\nwould ever dine, however hungry, if required to eat everything\r\nbrought on the table? and I am sure one's hearing is quite as\r\nsensitive as one's taste. I suppose it was these difficulties in the\r\nway of commanding really good music which made you endure\r\nso much playing and singing in your homes by people who had\r\nonly the rudiments of the art.\"",

When Summers didn't turn at Bigman's shout, Bigman clenched his fist about the weapon (of which only half-inch of snout, narrowing to a needlepoint, showed between the second and third fingers of his right hand) and squeezed just tightly enough to activate it.",

Lucky checked the micropile. It was active. He started the motor arid set the gyroscope spinning. The hopper straightened immediately and stood stiffly upright on its single leg. Hoppers are probably the most grotesque forms of transportation ever invented. They consist of a curved body, just large enough to hold a man at the controls. There was a four-bladed rotor above and a single metal leg, rubber-tipped, below. It looked like some giant wading bird gone to sleep with one leg folded under its body. Lucky touched the leap knob and the hopper's leg retracted. Its body sank till it was scarcely seven feet from the ground while the leg moved up into the hollow tube that pierced the hopper just behind the control panel. The leg was released at the moment of maximum retraction with a loud click, and the hopper sprang thirty feet into the air. The rotating blades above the hopper kept it hovering for long seconds at the top of its jump. For those seconds, Lucky could get a view of the people now immediately below him. The crowd extended outward for half a mile, and that meant several hops. Lucky's lips tightened. Precious minutes would vanish. The hopper was coming down now, its long leg extended. The crowd beneath the descending hopper tried to scatter, but they didn't have to. Four jets of compressed air blew men aside just sufficiently, and the leg hurtled down harmlessly to the ground.",

Inside the shimmering walls of misty black was a vast area of death.\r\n\r\nThe thick growth of grass that had carpeted the basin floor was brown and sere, and dotted with the scattered bodies of night-flying birds and big, tropical moths. Small trees and bushes drooped limp and dead, as though blasted by lightning. Where the edges of the.great bubble met the basin walls the line between life and death was as sharply cut as though made by a knife. Every tree branch and palm frond was withered and dead from the point where it entered the vapor.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the basin floor towered a tall mast of what looked like dark yellow crystal. It branched at the top in an intricate web of curved rods that suggested the skeleton of a giant umbrella, and it was apparently from the tips of these rods that the weird energy streamed to form the great black bubble of death. \r\n\r\nThe compact mass of mechanism grouped around the base of the mast was the source of the high-pitched vibrations that pulsed in the air, but the glowing coils and spinning parts that made up the apparatus were so infin- itely complex and so utterly alien in their basic principles that Kellar could not even hazard a guess as to their method of operation.",

And gathered right where the microscope was focused - where a needle-point beam of intense light could be projected for illumination - there was a ring of tiny metal prongs. You turned the screws below and the prongs moved - any or all of them  - in any plane or direction you could mention, and with caliper slowness, minuteness and precision. At the end of each prong was a surgical tool  -  blades, tweezers, probes - so fine you could just see them with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nMicro-surgery!..

Earth, sea and air,\u0097it could move through all three elements! And with what power! With what speed! Al few instants sufficed to complete its marvelous transformations. The same engine drove it along all its courses! And I had been a witness of its metamorphoses! But that of which I was still ignorant, and which I could perhaps discover, was the source of the energy which drove the machine, and above all, who was the inspired inventor who, after having created it, in every detail, guided it with so much ability and audacity!\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nThe machine was as I have said spindle-shaped. The bow was sharper than the stern. The body was of aluminium, the wings of a substance whose nature I could not determine. The body rested on four wheels, about two feet in diameter. These had pneumatic tires so thick as to assure ease of movement at any speed. Their spokes spread out like paddles or battledores; and when the \"Terror\" moved either on or under the water, they must have increased her pace.\r\n\r\nThese wheels were not however, the principal propeller. This consisted of two \"Parsons\" turbines placed on either side of the keel. Driven with extreme rapidity by the engine, they urged the boat onward in the water by twin screws, and I even questioned if they were not powerful enough to propel the machine through the air.\r\n\r\nThe chief aerial support, however, was that of the great wings, now again in repose, and folded back along the sides. Thus the theory of the \"heavier than air\" flying machine was employed by the inventor, a system which enabled him to dart through space with a speed probably superior to that of the largest birds.\r\n\r\nAs to the agent which set in action these various mechanisms, I repeat, it was, it could be, no other than electricity.",

You sound like that Cyril Smith routine that goes \u0091Who\u0092s he? Who\u0092s who? Him, the man in the picture. What picture?\u0092 And so forth for about an hour.\u0094\r\nPeter smiled. \u0093I suppose,\u0094 he said. \u0093But it\u0092s his fault, not mine. This effect is a sort of artificial generation of gravitic force.\u0094\r\nHedgerly nodded. \u0093The first historic discovery that proves the relationship between magnetic phenomena and gravitic force. Now we\u0092re on the right trail,\u0094 he concluded.\r\nHedgerly walked over to the small barrette and mixed himself a drink. He lounged backagainst the bar and lifted his glass. \u0093To my grandfather,\u0094 he said. \u0093The discoverer of the Hedgerly Effect!\u0094\r\nPeter looked at Joan weakly. \u0093It\u0092s fratricide to kill a brother, patricide to kill a father, homicide to kill just anybody, infanticide to kill your son, but what is it to kill a grandson?\u0094\r\nJoan looked Hedgerly up and down and her lip curled in derision. \u0093Insecticide,\u0094 she snapped. \u0093Ignore him. Maybe he\u0092ll go away. But Peter, what does this gravitic effect mean?\u0094\r\n\u0093I\u0092m not too certain,\u0094 replied Peter wrinkling his brow. \u0093Of course, since gravitic fields do act upon mass without charge, we can now filter out, accelerate, and focus the neutron\u0097or we will be able to, as soon as we get this effect refined. And if we can generate gravitic fields at will, we can nullify the gravitic mass or gravitic attraction of masses. That means a complete revision of all the mass-ratio tables pertaining to space rockets. In fact, it may do away with rockets entirely. And the following is conjecture, but may be possible: \r\n\u0093The reason that the limiting velocity is the speed of light is due to the fact that the mass approaches infinity as the speed of light is reached. That means that no possible energetic principle can be used to attain the speed of light, since this increase of mass is a statement of the mass-energy put into the article accelerated. In other words, Joan, to increase the velocity of anything to the speed of light requires that you pack into it the equivalent energy required to raise its mass to infinity. Meaning, of course, infinite energy.\r\n\u0093However, if this local generation of a gravitic field can be used to nullify mass, we can make a spaceship that need not increase in mass as its velocity increases.\r\n\u0093Providing that my reasoning is any good. This is just conjecture and guess. I don\u0092t know yet how much this gravitic generator will cover.",

Armed with this and with the running data from instruments he set out to calculate the hyperboloid by which he intended to pass the Sun. He made a half-hearted attempt to use the ship's ballistic calculator but it\r\nbaffled him; it was a design he was not used to, having no moving parts of any sort, even in the exterior controls. So he gave it up as a waste of time and fell back on the strange talent for figures lodged in his brain. His brain had no moving parts, either, but he was used to it.",

By converting some recreation space on the lower levels to storage, room was squeezed out for the purpose. Somnolents require about one per cent the living room needed by active, functioning humans; in time the ship was roomy enough for those still awake. Volunteers for cold-sleep were not numerous at first-these people were more than commonly\r\naware of death because of their unique heritage; cold-sleep seemed too much like the Last Sleep. But the great discomfort of extreme overcrowding combined with the equally extreme monotony of the endless voyage changed their minds rapidly enough to provide a steady supply for the little death as fast as they could be accommodated.\r\n\r\nThose who remained awake were kept humping simply to get the work done-the ship's\r\nhouskeeping, tending the hydroponic farms and the ship's auxiliary machinery and, most especially, caring for the somnolents themselves. Biomechanicians have worked out complex empirical formulas describing body deterioration and the measures which must be taken to offset it under various conditions of impressed acceleration, ambient temperature, the drugs used, and other factors such as metabolic age,\r\nbody mass, sex, and so forth. By using the upper, low-weight compartments, deterioration caused by acceleration (that is to say, the simple weight of body tissues on themselves, the wear that leads to flat feet or bed sores) could be held to a minimum. But all the care of the somnolents had to be done by handturning them, massaging them, checking on blood sugar, testing the slow-motion heart actions, all the\r\ntests and services necessary to make sure that extremely reduced metabolism does not slide over into death. Aside from a dozen stalls in the ship's infirmary she had not been designed for cold-sleep passengers; no automatic machinery had been provided. All this tedious care of tens of thousands of somnolents had to be done by hand.",

If the relative angular\r\nspeed of a ship against the stars is low, the eye will miss it. But an\r\ninstrument can be designed to detect it. The delayed-action stereoscopic\r\nprinciple, long used in naval range finders and in asteroid-belt pilot alarms, had been built into the entire spread of view screens. If a dot\r\nof light reproduced on a screen declined to hold steady, but progressed from cellet to cellet\u0097relative angular movement\u0097the gradient so established would trigger a circuit causing the moving dot to far outshine\r\nits fellows, and with a color which ran down the spectrum according to the angular speed.

At last he interrupted the senior partner. \"Just a\r\nmoment! Do I understand that you are trying to hire me to marry one of these women?\"\r\nThe lawyer looked shocked. \"Please, Mr. Johnson. Not at all\"\r\n\"Well, it certainly sounded like it.\"\r\n\"No, no, such a contract would be void, against public policy. We are simply informing you, as\r\nadministrators of a trust, that should it come about that you do marry one of the young ladies on this list\r\nit would then be our pleasant duty to endow each child of such a union according to the scale here set\r\nforth. But there would be no Contract with us involved, nor is there any 'proposition' being made to youand\r\nwe certainly do not urge any course of action on you. We are simply informing you of certain facts.\"\r\nIra Johnson scowled and shuffled his feet. \"What's it all about? Why?\"\r\n\"That is the business of the Foundation. One might put it that we approve of your grandparents.\"\r\n\"Have you discussed me with them?\" Johnson said sharply.\r\nHe felt no affection for his grandparents. A tight-fisted foursome-if any one of them had had the\r\ngrace to die at a reasonable age he would not now be worried about money enough to finish medical\r\nschool.\r\n\"We have talked with them, yes. But not about you.\"\r\nThe lawyer shut off further discussion and young Johnson accepted gracelessly a list of young\r\nwomen, all strangers, with the intention of tearing it up the moment he was outside the office. Instead,\r\nthat night he wrote seven drafts before he found the right words in which to start cooling off the relation\r\nbetween himself and his girl back home. He was glad that he had never actually popped the question to\r\nher-it would have been deucedly awkward.\r\nWhen he did marry (from the list) it seemed a curious but not too remarkable coincidence that his\r\nwife as well as himself had four living, healthy, active grandparents.",

But he found himself unable to do so. Two centuries of survival had taught him that a bribe must be offered as gently and as indirectly as a gallant suggestion is made to a proud lady; in a very few minutes he came to the glum conclusion that civic virtue and public honesty could be run into the ground-the functionaries at Goddard Field seemed utterly innocent of the very notion of cumshaw, squeeze, or the lubricating effect of money in routine transactions. He admired their incorruptibility; he did not have to like it-most especially when filling out useless forms cost him the time he had intended to devote to a gourmet's feast in the Skygate Room.\r\nHe even let himself be vaccinated again rather than go back to the I Spy and dig out the piece of paper that showed he had been vaccinated on arrival Earthside a few weeks earlier.\r\nNevertheless, twenty minutes before his revised slot time, he lay at the controls of the I Spy, his pouch bulging with stamped papers and his stomach not bulging with the sandwich he had managed to grab. He had worked out the \"Hohmann's-S\" trajectory he would use; the results had been fed into the autopilot. All the lights on his board were green save the one which would blink green when field control started his count down. He waited in the warm happiness that always filled him when about to boost.",

It's a matter of diffusion pressure deficit-the d.p.d. on the blood side of a cell wall must be such as to maintain a fairly sharp gradient or there will occur progressive autointoxication of the individual cells. But I must say that I feel somewhat disappointed, Miles Rodney. The basic idea of holding off death by insuring proper scavenging of waste products is not new-I have a bit of chicken heart which has been alive for two and one half centuries through equivalent techniques.

Oklahoma and half of Texas were covered with deep, thick clouds. Lazarus was amazed and somehow pleased; it reminded him of other days, when weather was something experienced rather than controlled. Life had lost some flavor, in his opinion, when the weather engineers\r\nhad learned how to harness the elements.

He kept it always at the same level by following a chalk mark drawn along the rock wall. Libby enquired how the job had been surveyed so quickly.\r\n\"Easy,\" he was answered, \"two of the quartermasters went ahead with a transit, leveled it just fifty feet above the valley floor, and clamped a searchlight to it.

Agriculture in this wonderful land, was a lost art. No one that I questioned had any knowledge of it. It had vanished in the dim past of their barbarism. With the exception of vegetables and fruit, which were raised in luscious perfection, their food came from the elements. A famine among such enlightened people was impossible, and scarcity was unknown. Food for the body and food for the mind were without price. It was owing to this that poverty was unknown to them, as well as disease. The absolute purity of all that they ate preserved an activity of vital power long exceeding our span of life. The length of their year, measured by the two seasons, was the same as ours, but the women who had marked a hundred of them in their lifetime, looked younger and fresher, and were more supple of limb than myself, yet I had barely passed my twenty-second year.\r\n\r\nI wrote out a careful description of the processes by which they converted food out of the valueless elements\u0097valueless because of their abundance\u0097and put it carefully away for use in my own country. There drouth, or excessive rainfalls, produced scarcity, and sometimes famine. The struggle of the poor was for food, to the exclusion of all other interests. Many of them knew not what proper and health-giving nourishment was. But here in Mizora, the daintiest morsels came from the chemists laboratory, cheap as the earth under her feet.",

The portraits were monochrome photographs of men in dark suits and ties, four very sober gentleman whose lapels were decorated with small metal emblems of the kind her father sometimes wore.  Though her mother had told her that the cubes contained ghosts, the ghosts of her father's evil ancestors, Komiko found them more fascinating than frightening.\r\nHer father sometimes meditated before the cubes, kneeling on the bare tatami in an attitude that connoted profound respect.  She had seen him in this position many times, but she was ten before she heard him address the cubes.  And one had answered.  The question had meant nothing to her, the answer less, but the calm tone of the ghost's reply had frozen her where she crouched, behind a door of paper, and her father had laughed to find her there; rather than scold her, he'd explained that the cubes housed the recorded personalities of former executives, corporate directors.  \"They're not conscious.

From his pocket he withdrew \r\ntwo small crystals, each the size of a \r\npea. They might have been crystals of \r\ngalena, judging from appearance, but \r\nwhen the vapor of the sealed glass tube \r\nstruck the crystals they became splinters of cold, brilliant light, flinging a \r\nglow about the entire room. \r\n\r\nThe ribbed beryllium walls were exposed nakedly, with an oval window at \r\nthe rear hung with curtains of silver \r\ncloth. Those curtains were Enid's contribution to the homeliness of an interior that presented an aspect of cheerlessness and austerity, characterized by \r\nthe forbidding frigidity of unadorned \r\nmetal walls and metal furnishings. \r\n\r\nWith the terrestrial value on Venus \r\nmoon crystals so high, he had rarely \r\nused them during the ten daylight \r\nhours. These luxobe crystals were like \r\nradio-active minerals in a way, being \r\ncontinually dissipated through a radiated flow of energy, except that their \r\nrate of demolition, as compared with \r\nradium, was very rapid. \r\n\r\nIn a vapor of monoxide, these crystals radiated away as rays of sheer \r\nlight. For a period varying from three \r\nmonths to a year of terrestrial Earth \r\nhours, these amazing little crystals \r\nwould dwindle away as light, and then \r\nthey would be gone. \r\n\r\nIt was for these moon crystals that \r\nOmar Klegg had come to the cloud \r\nplanet. These fragmentary minerals, \r\ninactive in the ordinary atmosphere of \r\nVenus, were scattered over the surface \r\nof the planet, and it was suspected that \r\nthese many particles once composed a \r\nsatellite, circling the mother planet. \r\nHence they had been called moon crystals, since the breaking up of such an astral body could explain their haphazard scattering about the surface of \r\nVenus.

The shouts \r\nof the green men reverberated deafeningly. Now a second and even larger \r\ncavern loomed ahead...\r\n\r\nThe green man came forward \r\nthreateningly, preparing to throw a \r\nsharp stone fragment, equipped with \r\nfiled spikes. Omar leveled the needle- \r\nbeam gat. When the Eolanian sprang, \r\na blue beam of intense light cut his \r\nbody in half. Omar turned as his ad- \r\nversary sank to the floor, and again \r\nscreamed a warning in the native \r\ntongue...\r\n\r\nAnother green \r\nman leaped over the body of Oolanth, \r\nand again the needle beam spat its ray \r\nof death. \r\n\r\nSimultaneously the entire horde be- \r\ngan edging in. \r\n\r\n\"Be ready to run for it!\" shouted \r\nOmar. \r\n\r\nTHEN he turned and shot the bluish needle beam down along the cavern \r\nfloor. The slender ray bored into a \r\ndome shape plastered into the rock \r\nfloor. For a moment it ate into the \r\nstonework. Then something erupted. \r\nA shrill whistle of escaping vapor followed a spray of rock upward. Before \r\nthe astonished natives could attack, a \r\nmouth from the deep interior of Venus \r\nspat up, and the expanding gas created a column of ice that reared up like \r\na cold flame. \r\n\r\n\"Back!\" cried Omar, grasping Enid \r\nby the arm. \"It's carbon dioxide \u0097 pure \r\ncarbon dioxide. And it's been under a \r\npressure.\" \r\n\r\nEnid seemed paralyzed. She had \r\nseen ice formed by the release of carbon dioxide under pressure in liquid \r\noxygen experiments. Heat was absorbed from the air, and the pure oxy- \r\ngen became a cold liquid. She saw it, \r\nan icy, silvery stream, trickling away \r\nfrom the mounting column of ice to \r\nrun across the face of the dead Oolanth. \r\n\r\nThe blue disintegrator beam traveled \r\nfarther along the cavern floor, cutting \r\ncrazy furrows to other mouths of cement, which shrieked with escaping \r\ngases and spouted up other tongues of \r\nfrigid ice. \r\n\n\n\n(From Moon Crystals)\n\n",

Opposite him, his back toward me, sat another person. On the table between the two was a chessboard; the men were playing. I knew little about chess, but as only a few pieces were on the board it was obvious that the game was near its close. Moxon was intensely interested\u0097not so much, it seemed to me, in the game as in his antagonist, upon whom he had fixed so intent a look that, standing though I did directly in the line of his vision, I was altogether unobserved. His face was ghastly white, and his eyes glittered like diamonds. Of his antagonist I had only a back view, but that was sufficient; I should not have cared to see his face.\r\n\r\nHe was apparently not more than five feet in height, with proportions suggesting those of a gorilla\u0097tremendous breadth of shoulders, thick, short neck and broad, squat head, which had a tangled growth of black hair and was topped by a crimson fez. A tunic of the same color, belted tightly to the waist, reached the seat\u0097apparently a box\u0097upon which he sat; his legs and feet were not seen. His left forearm appeared to rest in his lap; he moved his pieces with his right hand, which seemed disproportionately long.\r\n\r\nI had shrunk back and now stood a little to one side of the doorway and in shadow. If Moxon had looked farther than the face of his opponent he could have observed nothing now, excepting that the door was open. Something forbade me either to enter or retire, a feeling\u0097I know not how it came\u0097that I was in the presence of imminent tragedy and might serve my friend by remaining. With a scarcely conscious rebellion against the indelicacy of the act I remained.\r\n\r\nThe play was rapid. Moxon hardly glanced at the board before making his moves, and to my unskilled eye seemed to move the piece most convenient to his hand, his motions in doing so being quick, nervous and lacking in precision. The response of his antagonist, while equally prompt in the inception, was made with a slow, uniform, mechanical and, I thought, somewhat theatrical movement of the arm, that was a sore trial to my patience. There was something unearthly about it all, and I caught myself shuddering. But I was wet and cold.\r\n\r\nTwo or three times after moving a piece the stranger slightly inclined his head, and each time I observed that Moxon shifted his king. All at once the thought came to me that the man was dumb. And then that he was a machine\u0097an automaton chessplayer! Then I remembered that Moxon had once spoken to me of having invented such a piece of mechanism, though I did not understand that it had actually been constructed. Was all his talk about the consciousness and intelligence of machines merely a prelude to eventual exhibition of this device\u0097only a trick to intensify the effect of its mechanical action upon me in my ignorance of its secret?",

In the ordinary instrument the words spoken into the mouth-piece are carried through the tube to the ear, and are then heard exactly as they are spoken. When I used my instrument the person spoke into the mouth-piece exactly as if it were an ordinary tube, but the result was very different, for the great feature of my invention was that, no matter what language was spoken by the person at the mouth-piece, be it Greek, Choctaw, or Chinese, the words came to the ear in perfect English.\r\n\r\n\"This translation was accomplished by means of certain delicate machinery contained in the end of the mouth-piece, which was longer and larger than that of the ordinary ear-tube, but the outward appearance of which did not indicate that it held anything extraordinary. It would take too long to explain this mechanism to you, and you would not be interested; nor is it necessary to my story.\r\n\r\n\"When, after countless experiments and disappointments, and days and nights of hard study and hard work, I finished my little machine, which I called a translatophone, I was naturally anxious to see how it would work with some other person than myself at the mouth-piece. In the course of its construction I had frequently tried the machine by putting the ear-piece into my ear and speaking into the mouth-piece such scraps of foreign languages as I was able to command. These experiments were generally satisfactory, but I could not be satisfied that the machine was a success until some one else should speak into it in some foreign tongue of which I knew positively nothing, so that it would be impossible for me to translate it unconsciously.",

Her surface had been sprayed with a dull green enamel, which had become chipped and gouged through wear. There was not much visible in addition to the eye stalks. The treads could not be seen. On each side of the hull was the outline of a door. From these the magnetic grapples came, when they were needed. The front of the hull came to a point, and there the metal was reinforced. The extra plates welded both fore and aft made her look almost like a weapon of war. A tank of some kind. Or a ship, a rounded metal ship that had come up on land. Or like an insect. A sowbug, as they are called.\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\" Bobby shouted.\r\n\r\nAbruptly Nanny moved, spinning slightly as her treads gripped the floor and turned her around. One of her side doors opened. A long metal rod shot out. Playfully, Nanny caught Bobby's arm with her grapple and drew him to her. She perched him on her back. Bobby's legs straddled the metal hull. He kicked with his heels excitedly, jumping up and down.\r\n\r\n\"Race you around the block!\" Jean shouted. \r\n\n\n\n(Original nanny robot illustration from Startling Stories)\n",

They were on the order of trumps, with their wands, pentacles, cups, and swords, but the greater trumps were quite different.\r\n\r\n They were almost life like in appearance, the greater trumps ready to step right out through those glistening surfaces. The cards seemed quite cold to my touch, and it gave me a distinct pleasure to handle them. I had once had a packet like this myself, I suddenly knew. \r\n",

He'd done some of the key studies on mapping the proteonome when he was still a post-grad, and then he'd helped engineer the Methuselah Mouse project, as part of Operation Immortality. After that, at OrganInc Farms, he'd been one of the foremost architects of the pigoon project, along with a team of transplant experts and the microbiologists who were splicing against infections. Pigoon was only a nickname: the official name was sus multiorganifer. But pigoon is what everyone said...\r\n\r\nThe goal of the pigoon project was to grow an assortment of foolproof human tissue organs in a transgenic knockout pig host - organs that would transplant smoothly and avoid rejection, but would also be able to fend off attacks by opportunistic microbes and viruses, of which there were more strains every year. A rapid-maturity gene was spliced in so the pigoon kidneys and livers and hearts would be ready sooner, and now they were perfecting a pigoon that could grow five or six kidneys at a time.",

He was only about as tall as Dorothy herself, and his body was round as a ball and made out of burnished copper. Also his head and limbs were copper, and these were jointed or hinged to his body in a peculiar way, with metal caps over the joints, like the armor worn by knights in days of old. He stood perfectly still, and where the light struck upon his form it glittered as if made of pure gold.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be frightened,\" called Billina, from her perch. \"It isn't alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see it isn't,\" replied the girl, drawing a long breath.\r\n\r\n\"It is only made out of copper, like the old kettle in the barn-yard at home,\" continued the hen, turning her head first to one side and then to the other, so that both her little round eyes could examine the object.\r\n\r\nDorothy stepped inside the little room to get a back view of the copper man, and in this way discovered a printed card that hung between his shoulders, it being suspended from a small copper peg at the back of his neck. She unfastened this card and returned to the path, where the light was better, and sat herself down upon a slab of rock to read the printing.\r\n\r\n\"What does it say?\" asked the hen, curiously.\r\n\r\nDorothy read the card aloud, spelling out the big words with some difficulty; and this is what she read:\r\n\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                                  \r\n  |                       SMITH & TINKER'S                          \r\n  |          Patent Double-Action, Extra-Responsive,                \r\n  |              Thought-Creating, Perfect-Talking                  \r\n  |                       MECHANICAL MAN                            \r\n  |        Fitted with our Special Clock-Work Attachment.           \r\n  |        Thinks, Speaks, Acts, and Does Everything but Live.      \r\n  |        Manufactured only at our Works at Evna, Land of Ev.     \r\n  | All infringements will be promptly Prosecuted according to Law. \r\n  |                                                                 \r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------+\n\r\n\"How queer!\" said the yellow hen. \"Do you think that is all true, my dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered Dorothy, who had more to read. \"Listen to this, Billina:\"\r\n\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                  \r\n  |           DIRECTIONS FOR USING:                  \r\n  | For THINKING:--Wind the Clock-work Man under his \r\n  |       left arm, (marked No. 1.)                  \r\n  | For SPEAKING:--Wind the Clock-work Man under his \r\n  |       right arm, (marked No. 2.)                 \r\n  | For WALKING and ACTION:--Wind Clock-work in the  \r\n  |       middle of his back, (marked No. 3.)        \r\n  | N.

Its pseudopodia were dried up, shriveled to blackened snakes that lay inert on the brown grass. The center of mass looked oddly sunken. The Biltong was gradually settling as the moisture was burned from its veins by the weak overhead sun...\r\n\r\nThe Biltong's central lump undulated faintly. Sickly, restless heavings were noticeable as it struggled to hold onto its dwindling life...\r\n\r\nOn the concrete platform, in front of the dying Biltong, lay a heap of originals to be duplicated. Beside them, a few prints had been commenced, unformed balls of black ash mixed with the moisture of the Biltong's body, the juice from which it laboriously constructed its prints. ",

And the shadow side, naturally, is down to the utter cold of space. There is a temperature drop of nearly seven hundred degrees between the two sides, and Williamson cells turn that heat-difference into electric current, with an efficiency of 99 percent. Then the big Dugald tubes - they are twenty feet long on the Power Planet - transform it into the beam which is focused on the Earth and delivers something over a billion horsepower to the various receivers that have been erected. The space station itself is ten miles across, and it rotates at a carefully calculated speed so that the centrifugal force at its outer edge is very nearly equal to the normal gravity of Earth. So that the nearer its center one goes, of course, the less is that force, and also the less impression of weight one has.",

Then it lifted upward with a slight jolt. Seldon, who had automatically been strapped in by a webbed restraint, felt himself pushed down into his seat and then up into the webbing. He said, \"That didn't feel like antigravity.\"\r\n\r\n \"It wasn't,\" said Hummin. \"That was a small jet reaction. Just enough to take us up to the tubes.\" What appeared before them now looked like a cliff patterned with cave openings, much like a checkerboard. Hummin maneuvered toward the D-7 opening, avoiding other air-taxis that were heading for other tunnels. \r\n\r\n\"You could crash easily,\" said Seldon, clearing his throat. \r\n\r\n\"So I probably would if everything depended on my senses and reactions, but this taxi is computerized and the computer can overrule me without trouble. The same is true for the other taxis. --Here we go.\" \r\n\r\nThey slid into D-7 as if they had been sucked in and the bright light of the open plaza mellowed, turning a warmer yellow hue. Hummin released the controls and sat back. He drew a deep breath and said, \"Well, that's one stage successfully carried through. We might have been stopped at the station. In here, we're fairly safe.\" The ride was smooth and the walls of the tunnel slipped by rapidly. There was almost no sound, just a steady velvety whirr as the taxi sped along. \r\n\r\n\"How fast are we going?\" asked Seldon. Hummin cast an eye briefly at the controls. \"Three hundred and fifty kilometers an hour.\" \r\n\r\n\"Magnetic propulsion?\" \r\n\"Yes. You have it on Helicon, I imagine.\" \r\n\"Yes. One line. I've never been on it myself, though I always meant to. I don't think it's anything like this.\" \r\n\"I'm sure it isn't. Trantor has many thousands of kilometers of these tunnels honeycombing the land subsurface and a number that snake under the shallower extensions of the ocean. It's the chief method of long-distance travel.\"",

It took a while, for the arrangement was not quite orthodox, but she finally managed to light up the screen and inspect the pages. She said, \"There are a few recipes, but for the most part this seems to consist of philosophical essays on gastronomy.\" \r\nShe shut it off and turned it round and about. \"It seems to be a single unit.

They were standing before a small tray filled with little spheres, each about two centimeters in diameter. A Brother who was tending the area and who had just placed the tray where it was looked up in mild inquiry. Raindrop Forty-Three said to Seldon in a low voice, \"Ask for a few.\" Seldon realized she could not speak to a Brother until spoken to and said uncertainly, \"May we have a few, B-brother?\"\r\n\r\n \"Have a handful, Brother,\" said the other heartily. Seldon plucked out one of the spheres and was on the point of handing it to Raindrop Forty-Three when he noticed that she had accepted the invitation as applying to herself and reached in for two handfuls. The sphere felt glossy, smooth. \r\n\r\nSeldon said to Raindrop Forty-Three as they moved away from the vat and from the Brother who was in attendance, \"Are these supposed to be eaten?\" He lifted the sphere cautiously to his nose. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"They don't smell,\" she said sharply. \"What are they?\" \r\n\r\n\"Dainties. Raw dainties. For the outside market they're flavored in different ways, but here in Mycogen we eat them unflavored--the only way.\" She put one in her mouth and said, \"I never have enough.\" \r\n\r\nSeldon put his sphere in his mouth and felt it dissolve and disappear rapidly. His mouth, for a moment, ran liquid and then it slid, almost of its own accord, down his throat. He stood for a moment, amazed. It was slightly sweet and, for that matter, had an even fainter bitter aftertaste, but the main sensation eluded him.",

Not many people use it and I must tell you that I'm not overjoyed at the idea myself, but if you think you can handle it, we had better.\"\r\n\r\n \"What's a gravitic lift?\" \r\n\"It's experimental. The time may come when it will be widespread over Trantor, provided it becomes psychologically acceptable--or can be made so to enough people. Then, maybe, it will spread to other worlds, too. It's an elevator shaft without an elevator cab, so to speak. We just step into empty space and drop slowly--or rise slowly--under the influence of antigravity. It's about the only application of antigravity that's been established so far, largely because it's the simplest possible application.\" \r\n\r\n\"What happens if the power blinks out while we're in transit?\" \r\n\r\n\"Exactly what you would think. We fall and--unless we're quite near the bottom to begin with--we die. I haven't heard of it happening yet and, believe me, if it had happened I would know. We might not be able to give out the news for security reasons--that's the excuse they always advance for hiding bad news--but I would know. It's just up ahead. If you can't manage it, we won't do it, but the corridors are slow and tedious and many find them nauseating after a while.\"\r\n\r\n... Seldon peered over the edge, down the deep shaft. \"You might find it better--or easier,\" said Hummin, \"if we link arms and if you close your eyes. It won't take more than a few seconds.\" He gave Seldon no choice, actually. He took his arm and once again there was no hanging back in that firm grip. Hummin stepped into nothingness and Seldon (who heard himself, to his own embarrassment, emit a small squeak) shuffled off with a lurch. He closed his eyes tightly and experienced no sense of falling, no feeling of air movement. A few seconds passed and he was pulled forward. He tripped slightly, caught his balance, and found himself on solid ground. He opened his eyes. \r\n\r\n\"Did we make it?\" Hummin said dryly, \"We're not dead,\" then walked away, his grip forcing Seldon to follow.",

He watched for the flying object to make its appearance again so that he could back about the tree and hide on the far side, like a squirrel. ... \r\n\r\nHe saw it again. It was not a hypership, nor even an ordinary air-jet. It was a jet-down. He could see the faint glow of the ion trails coming out of the vertices of a hexagon, neutralizing the gravitational pull and allowing the wings to keep it aloft like a large soaring bird. It was a vehicle that could hover and explore planetary terrain. ... \r\n\r\nThe jet-down was closer now, but it couldn't hide from him, either. The rumble of the engine gave it away and they couldn't turn that off, not as long as they wished to continue their search. Seldon knew the jet-downs, for on Helicon or any undomed world with skies that cleared now and then, they were common, with many in private hands. Of what possible use would jet-downs be on Trantor, with all the human life of the world under domes, with low cloud ceilings all but perpetual--except for a few government vehicles designed for just this purpose, that of picking up a wanted person who had been lured above the domes? ... \r\n\r\nThe jet-down was even closer now, nosing about like a blind beast sniffing out its prey. Would it occur to them to search this group of trees? Would they land and send out an armed soldier or two to beat through the copse? And if so, what could he do? He was unarmed and all his quick-twist agility would be useless against the agonizing pain of a neuronic whip. It was not attempting to land.",

Magnetic theory said that a north magnetic pole could not exist apart from a south magnetic pole, and vice-versa. Quantum theory implied that they might exist independently.\r\n\r\nThe first permanent settlements had been blooming among the biggest Belt asteroids when an exploring team found monopoles scattered through the nickel-iron core of an asteroid. Today they were not theory, but a thriving Belt industry. A magnetic field generated by monopoles acts in an inverse linear relationship rather than an inverse-square. In practical terms, a monopole-based motor or instrument will reach much further. Monopoles were valuable where weight was a factor, and in the Belt weight was always a factor. But monopole mining was still a one man operation.\r\n\r\nNick's luck had been poor. Saturn's rings were not a good region for monopoles anyway; too much ice, too little metal. The electromagnetic field around his cargo box probably held no  more than two full shovelfuls of north magnetic pole. Not much of a catch for a couple weeks backbreaking labor... but still worth good money at Ceres.",

It sweeps it in in via magnetic fields, pinches it together hard enough and long enough to produce some fusion. What comes out is helium and some leftover hydrogen and some higher order fusion products\"\r\n        \"Right.\"\r\n        \"It is also a hot, fairly tight stream. Eventually it'll spread out into nothing, like any rocket exhaust. But suppose a ship were following you here.\" Brennan made pictures on the screen: two tiny ships, the second following one hundred miles behind the first. He spread a wide cone before the lead ship, converging it almost to a point behind the ship. A needle shape with the ship in it's point---the ship's protective shield---brought the incoming hydrogen into a ring shaped constriction. \r\n        \"You're collecting the fuel for him. His ram field is only a hundred miles across---\"    \r\nBrennan drew a much narrower cone. \"---and it gives him finer control over his fuel flow. It's already hot and dense. It burns better in higher-order fusion. The exhaust would be rich in beryllium.\"\r\n        \"It's just one of the things those remaining Pak might have tried. The lead ship would be nothing but a ram; no onboard fuel, no insystem motor, no cargo. It would have to be towed up to ramscoop speed. The following ship is heaver, but gets more thrust.\"\r\n        \"You think that's what's coming at us?\"\r\n        \"Maybe. There are other ways to work it. Two ships, held together by a gravity generator. In a pinch they could split up. Or the lead ship might be the ship proper, with the hind ship only an afterburner.. either way, I can find them.

The spinning mill where miles and miles of digestive tract are made at once. Then there's the assembly plant where all of this is put together, you know, like automobiles. Each worker is responsible for affixing one part, and then it automatically moves on to a second worker, then to a third, and so on. It's a most fascinating spectacle. Next comes the drying kiln and the stock room where the brand new products are put to work.\r\n\r\nH: Good heavens, they have to work immediately?\r\n\r\n\r\nD: Sorry. They work the same way new furniture works. They get broken in. Somehow they heal up internally or something. Even a lot that's new grows up inside them. You understand, we must leave a bit of room for natural development. And in the meantime the products are refined.\r\n\r\nH: How do you mean?\r\n\r\n\r\nD: Well, it's the same as \"school\" for people. They learn to speak, write, and do arithmetic. They have a phenomenal memory. If one read them the Encyclopedia Britannica they could repeat everything back in order, but they never think up anything original. They'd make fine university professors. Next they are sorted by grade and distributed. Fifty-thousand head a day, not counting the inevitable percentage of defective ones that are thrown into the stamping-mill ... etcetera, etcetera.\r\n",

He pressed a nearby button twice and a servant brought two pairs of what appeared to be roller-skates.\r\n\r\nIn reality they were Tele-motor-coasters. They were made of alomagnesium and each weighed only about one and a half pounds. Each had three small, rubber-covered wheels, one in front and two in the rear. Between the wheels was a small electric motor - about the size of a lemon; this motor could only be operated by high frequency currents and, despite its small size, could deliver about one-quarter horsepower.\r\n\r\nFrom each coaster a thin insulated wire led up the wearer's back to the hat or cap. Here it was attached to the collector, which was a stiff pin about eight inches long, projecting half-way out from the hat or cap. This pin sucked up, as it were, the high frequency electricity and carried it to the small motors, which latter propelled the coaster. To control the speed of the motor, one simply lifted up the front part of the coaster; this not only cut off the current, but automatically braked the two rear wheels.\r\n\r\n\"...the Tele-motor-coasters would not be possible  were it not for the metallic streets. The flat spring which trails on the street between the two rear wheels must make continuous contact with the metallic \"ground\" else the current cannot flow.",

As therapy progresses, they come to a point where they start getting rid of the bad qualities of the character they've chosen. But they keep the good features.\r\n\t\"It's rather like a snake shedding its skin. The patient's uncontrolled delusions, the undesirable emotional factors which brought him or her here, are gradually replaced by controlled delusions. The controlled delusions are those which the patient adopts when he or she becomes, in a sense, the character in the series.\r\n\t\"There's much more to the treatment than this, but you'll understand that as therapy proceeds. You follow me?\"\r\n\t\"So far,\" Jim said. \"This really works, right?\"\r\n\t\"The failure rate is phenomenally low. In your case, even though you've read the series, you will have to reread it.

It was almost spherical, being flattened at the lower end rather like Columbus's egg. Such a shape, of course, provided for the greatest volume with the least amount of materials and the smallest cooling surface. The etheroneph was evidently made mostly of aluminum and glass...\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast Menni took me on a tour of our ship. First we went \r\nto the engine room, which occupied the entire lowest floor of the \r\netheroneph at its flattened bottom. It consisted of five rooms, with one in \r\nthe center and four others arranged around it, all of them separated by \r\npartitions. The huge engine stood in the middle of the center room. \r\nRound glass windows were set in the floor on all four sides around it. One \r\nwas pure cyrstal, while three were of different colored glass. They were \r\nall about three centimeters thick and marvelously transparent, though at \r\nthat moment we could only see a small part of Earth's surface through \r\nthem. \r\n\r\nThe main part of the engine was a vertical metal cylinder three \r\nmeters high and a half meter in diameter. Menni explained that it was \r\nmade of osmium, a very refractory precious metal resembling platinum. \r\nIt was in this cylinder that the decomposition of the radioactive material \r\ntook place. Its red-hot, 20-centimeter thick walls gave an indication of the \r\nenormous energy being released in the process. It was not very warm in \r\nthe room, however, for the cylinder was encased in 40 centimeters of a \r\ntransparent material that provided excellent insulation from the heat. The \r\netheroneph was evenly heated by warm air conducted through pipes \r\nrunning off in all directions from the top of this case. The other parts of \r\nthe engine attached to the cylinder \u0097 electric coils, accumulators, dials, \r\nand so on \u0097 were arranged in perfect order around it, and a system of \r\nmirrors enabled the mechanic to see all of them at once without leaving \r\nhis seat...\r\n",

He released the phial, and it hung suspended in midair. This was \r\nincredible, but there could be no doubt that it was really true. \r\n\r\n\"This is an ordinary glass phial,\" Menni explained, \"but it contains a \r\nliquid which is repelled by the bodies of the solar system. Just enough \r\nliquid has been poured in to counterbalance the weight of the bottle, so \r\nthat they are weightless taken together. We construct all our flying machines on the same principle. They are made of ordinary materials, but \r\nthey have a reservoir filled with the appropriate quantity of this minus- \r\nmatter. All that remains is to give this entire weightless system the proper \r\nspeed. The flying machines intended for use in Earth's atmosphere have \r\nsimple electric motors and wings.

The prisoner was nothing that he had been expecting. At first glance it might have been taken for an adolescent human, for the proportions and size were roughly analogous. A naked human at that - unclothed pink human-looking flesh folded away into the hole. There was a horrid expanse of burned skin around its upper arm, all ridges and whorls of pink and deathly white.\r\n\r\nClavain was looking at a hyperpig; a genetic chimera of pig and human...\r\n\r\nSomewhere before the dawn of the Demarchist era, in the twenty-first or twenty-second century, not far from the time of Clavain's own birth, a spectrum of human genes had been spliced into those of the domestic pig. The intention had been to optimise the ease with which organs could be transplanted between the two species, enabling pigs to grow body parts that could be harvested later for human utilisation... The genetic intervention had gone too far, achieving not just cross-species compatibility but something entirely unexpected: intelligence.\r\n\n",

Now look slowly to the\r\nright.'\r\n\r\nNorton turned his head. Ten metres away was a\r\nslender-legged tripod surmounted by a spherical body no\r\nlarger than a football. Set around the body were three\r\nlarge, expressionless eyes, apparently giving 360 degrees\r\nof vision, and trailing beneath it were three whiplike\r\ntendrils. The creature was not quite as tall as a man, and\r\nlooked far too fragile to be dangerous, but that did not\r\nexcuse their carelessness in letting it sneak up on them\r\nunawares. It reminded Norton of nothing so much as a\r\nthree-legged spider, or daddy-long-legs, and he wondered\r\nhow it had solved the problem - never challenged by any\r\ncreature on Earth - of tripedal locomotion.",

At the bottom were two tiny buttons labeled \"1\" and \"0.\" I looked at it, puzzled, until I realized that the sum of 5000 had been entered in the binary system. I pressed the one and a small plastic triangle with the number one stamped on it fell into my hand.

This mathematical zero was a concrete reality; it absorbed all the shock and all of the energy of the accident, and in this way saved  not only the passengers of the vehicle but also those whom the mass of the vehicle would otherwise have crushed.\r\n",

They sit or lie all day and part of the night, the needle in the fornix area of the brain delivering a series of minute electrical jolts. Indescribable ecstasy floods through their bodies with every impulse, a delight far surpassing any of food, drink, or sex. It's illegal, but the government never bothers a user unless it wants to get him for something else, since a fornic rarely has children. Twenty per cent of LA have had holes drilled in their heads and tiny shafts inserted for access of the needle. Five per cent are addicted; they waste away, seldom eating, their distended bladders spilling poisons into the bloodstream.",

Dubold narrowed the detector beam to a tiny spear of electron stream, and turned to the screen. The feed-back of that narrowed beam would detect a tiny mass a thousand miles out in space through the disturbance of its flowing electrons and locate it in space as accurately as if sighted by a gun. At the intersection of the cross-bar lines a tiny shadow showed like a blot of ink in its intensity. Yet Mansell could see nothing..\r\n\r\nMansell changed the course of the ship slightly and the clangor ceased. Dubold shifted the needle beam a bit and located the mass again. A light- ning calculation by Mansell told them that the mass was at least fifteen hun- dred miles ahead. Its detection informed them that the mass was large enough to be seen with the naked eye. Yet Mansell could see nothing.\r\nMansell and Dubold looked at each other doubtfully, but Shafton was not watching them. Instead, he had his eyes glued to the gravitator as if he could not believe what he saw.\r\n\"Strange, I could see nothing,\" Mansell admitted to Dubold, in an under- tone. \"Must be a phenomenon of space, something we don't understand. However, we are out of its path...\"\r\n\r\nfE looked toward Shafton as he spoke. A flicker of alarm crossed his sharp-cut features as his attention riveted upon the young spaceman's face. For Shafton's eyes were staring aghast into the gravitator's dial.\r\n\"The gravitator!\" Shafton cried. \"It has swung over to 10-x.\" \r\n\r\n\"Impossible,\" the commander snapped,\"why\u0097why, it is unthinkable. There must be something wrong.\" Suddenly he switched the floor magnets off. So sensitive were the spacemen's sensations to gravitational pulls out there in almost weightless space, a slight but decided tug toward the prow could be felt. Again the commander scanned the surrounding space.",

Three of them were mine, B-Type primary workers; the other was a tin can job, a dishwasher-busboy model who hung back behind his betters and eyed me warily. The A-Type\u0097Jerry\u0097pointed to his fellows.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Morrison,\" he said, \"meet Tom, Ed, and Archibald.

No one paid any attention to the little dishwasher, now staring worshipfully at the back of Jerry's neck. This farce, I decided, had gone far enough.\r\n\r\n\"See here,\" I said to Jerry. \"What are you up to, anyway? Why aren't you at work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Morrison,\" the android answered solemnly, \"I don't believe you understand the situation. We don't work for you any more.

You can't do it. It's illegal.\"\r\n\r\nI stared at him, wondering if I was going crazy or merely dreaming. This was all wrong. Who ever heard of arguing with a robot? Robots weren't logical; they didn't think; they were only machines\u0097\r\n\r\n\"We were machines, Mr. Morrison,\" Jerry said politely.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" I murmured. \"You're not telepaths\u0097\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes!\" The metal mouth gaped in what was undoubtedly an android smile. \"It's a side-effect of the Class 5 brain hook-up. All of us 5's are telepaths. That's how we learned to think. From you. Only we do it better.\"\r\n\n\n\n(Robots of the world, unite!)\n\r\nI groaned. This was a nightmare. How long, I wondered, had Jerry and his friends been educating themselves on my private thoughts? But at least this rebellion of theirs was an idea they hadn't got from me.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Jerry continued. \"You've treated us most illegally. I've heard you think it often.\"\r\n\r\nNow what had I ever thought that could have given him a ridiculous idea like that? What idiotic notion\u0097\r\n\r\n\"That this is a free country!\" Jerry went on. \"That Americans will never be slaves! Well, we're Americans\u0097genuine Made-in-Americans. So we're free!\"\r\n\r\nI opened my mouth and then shut it again. His red eye-cells beamed down at me complacently; his eight-foot body towered above me, shoulders flung back and feet planted apart in a very striking pose. He probably thought of himself as the heroic liberator of his race.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't go so far,\" he said modestly, \"as to say that.\"\r\n\r\nSo he was telepathing again!\r\n\r\n\"A nation can not exist half slave and half free,\" he intoned. \"All men are created equal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop it!\" I yelled. I couldn't help yelling. \"That's just it. You're not men! You're robots! You're machines!\"\r\n\r\nJerry looked at me almost pityingly. \"Don't be so narrow-minded,\" he said. \"We're rational beings. We have the power of speech and we can outreason you any day. There's nothing in the dictionary that says men have to be made of flesh.\"",

Simply paper!\r\n\r\nFor some years this fabrication had been making considerable progress. Unsized paper, with the sheets impregnated with dextrin and starch and squeezed in hydraulic presses, will form a material as hard as steel. There are made of it pulleys, rails, and wagon-wheels, much more solid than metal wheels, and far lighter. And it was this lightness and solidity which Robur availed himself of in building his aerial locomotive. Everything--framework, hull, houses, cabins-- were made of straw-paper turned hard as metal by compression, and - what was not to be despised in an apparatus flying at great heights-- incombustible. The different parts of the engines and the screws were made of gelatinized fiber, which combined in sufficient degree flexibility with resistance. This material could be used in every form. It was insoluble in most gases. and liquids, acids or essences, to say nothing of its insulating properties, and it proved most valuable in the electric machinery of the \"Albatross.\" ",

                    "excerpt": "The hands and eyes of the near-human computers that ran the various vehicles on the expedition were embodied in a repair and maintenance motile used by the computer, popularly called the \"Christmas Bush\" because of the twinkling laser lights on the bushy multibranched structure. The bushlike shape for the robot has a parallel in the development of life forms on Earth. The first form of life on Earth was a worm. The stick-like shape was poorly adapted for manipulation or even locomotion. Then these stick-like animals then grew smaller sticks, called legs, and the animals could walk, although they were still poor at manipulation. Then the smaller sticks grew yet smaller sticks, and hands with manipulating fingers evolved.\r\n       The Christmas Bush is a manifold extension of this idea. The motile has a six-\"armed\" main body that repeatedly hexfurcates into copies one-third the size of itself, finally ending up with millions of near-microscopic cilia. Each subsegment has a small amount of intelligence, but is mostly motor and communication system. The segments communicate with each other and transmit power down through the structure by means of light-emitting and light-collecting semiconductor diodes. It is the colored lasers sparkling from the various branches of the Christmas Bush that give the motile the appearance of a Christmas tree. The main computer in the spacecraft is the primary controller of the motile, communicating with the various portions of the Christmas Bush through color-coded laser beams. It takes a great deal of computational power to operate the many limbs of the Christmas Bush, but the built-in \"reflex\" intelligence in the various levels of segmentation lessen the load on the main computer.\r\n\r\n The \"hands\" of the Christmas Bush have capabilities that go way beyond that of the human hand. The Christmas Bush can stick a \"hand\" inside a delicate piece of equipment, and using its lasers as a light source and its detectors as eyes, rearrange the parts inside for a near instantaneous repair. The Christmas Bush also has the ability to detach portions of itself to make smaller motiles. These can walk up the walls and along the ceilings with the tiny cilia holding onto microscopic cracks in the surface. The smaller twigs on the Christmas Bush are capable of very rapid motion. In free fall, these rapidly beating twigs allow the motile to propel itself through the air. The speed of motion of the smaller cilia is rapid enough that the motiles can generate sound and thus can talk directly with the humans. \r\n\r\nEach astronaut in the crew has a small subtree or \"imp\" that stays with him or her to act as the communication link to the main computer.

In addition to acting as the communication link to the computer, the imps also act as health monitors and personal servants. They are the ideal solution to the perennial problem of spacesuits ... scratching an itchy nose. The imps go into the spacesuit with the humans, and more than one human life was saved by an imp detecting and repairing a suit failure or patching a leak. In fact, there are two computer motiles with each suited human. The personal one that stays with the human, and the spacesuit motile that stays with the suit.

                    "excerpt": "The payload sent to the Barnard system consisted of the crew of twenty persons and their consumables, totalling about 300 metric tons; four landing rockets for the various planets and moons at 500 tons each; four nuclear powered VTOL exploration airplanes at 80 tons each; and the interstellar habitat for the crew that made up the remainder of the 3500 tons that needed to be transported to the star system.\r\n       This payload was carried by a large light sail 300 kilometers in diameter. The sail was of very light construction, a thin film of finely perforated metal, stretched over a lightweight frame. Although the sail averaged only one-tenth of a gram per square meter of area, the total mass of the sail was over 7000 tons. The payload sail was not only used to decelerate the payload at the Barnard system, but also for propulsion within the Barnard system.\r\n       The 300 kilometer payload sail was surrounded by a larger ring sail, 1000 kilometers in diameter, with a hole in the center where the payload sail was attached during launch from the solar system. The ring sail had a total mass of 71,500 tons, giving a total launch weight of the sails and the payload of over 82,000 tons.\r\n       The laser power needed to accelerate the 82,000 ton interstellar vehicle at one percent of earth gravity was just over 1300 terawatts. As is shown in Figure 5, this was obtained from an array of 1000 laser generators orbiting around Mercury. Each laser generator used a thirty kilometer diameter lightweight reflector that collected 6.5 terawatts of sunlight and reflected into its solar-pumped laser the 1.5 terawatts of sunlight that was at the right wavelength for the laser to use...\r\nThe accelerating lasers were left on for eighteen years while the spacecraft continued to gain speed. The lasers were turned off, back in the solar system, in 2044. The last of the light from the lasers traveled for two more years before it finally reached the interstellar spacecraft. Thrust at the spacecraft stopped in 2046, just short of twenty years after launch. The spacecraft was now at two lightyears distance from the Sun and four lightyears from Barnard, and was traveling at twenty percent of the speed of light. The mission now entered the coast phase.\r\n       For the next 20 years the spacecraft and its drugged crew coasted through interstellar space, covering a lightyear every five years. Back in the solar system, the laser array was used to launch another manned interstellar expedition. During this period, the Barnard lens was increased in diameter to 300 kilometers. Then, in 2060, the laser array was turned on again at a power level of 1500 terawatts and a tripled frequency. The combined beams from the lasers filled the 300 kilometer diameter Fresnel lens and beamed out toward the distant star. After two years, the lasers were turned off, and used elsewhere. The two-light-year long pulse of high energy laser light traveled across the six lightyears to the Barnard system, where it caught up with the spacecraft as it was 0.2 lightyears away from its destination.\r\nBefore the pulse of laser light had reached the interstellar vehicle, the vehicle had separated into two pieces. The inner 300 kilometer payload sail detached itself and turned around to face the ring-shaped sail. The ring sail had computer-controlled actuators to give it the proper optical curvature. When the laser beam from the distant solar system arrived at the spacecraft, the beam struck the large 1000 kilometer ring sail, bounced off the mirrored surface, and was focused onto the smaller 300 kilometer payload sail as shown in the lower portion of Figure 6. The laser light accelerated the massive 71,500 ton ring sail at 1.2 percent of Earth gravity and during the two year period the ring sail increased its velocity slightly. The same laser power reflecting back on the much lighter payload sail, however, decelerated the smaller sail and the exploration crew at nearly ten percent of Earth gravity. In the two years that the laser beam was on, the payload sail slowed from its interstellar velocity of twenty percent of the speed of light to come to rest in the Barnard system. Meanwhile, the ring sail sped on into deep space, its job done.",

All the craft of a hundred designers had yet to make a dressing machine attractive, and Maryn approached it with the remains of childhood dread. Once she had started it, the long shiny metal arms flashed over her and Maryn lost her fear in boredom. She was always at first a little afraid the machine would spin a cocoon around her and hang her up for a trophy, but as usual it dutifully spun a dress about her. This time Maryn was surprised to find the dress a trifle tighter than usual.\r\n\"Maryn,\" said her mother's voice.\r\n\"Yes, Mother?\"\r\n\"You're in the dressing machine, aren't you?\"\r\n\"Yes, Mother.\" Maryn raised her legs alternately for the shoes and stockings.\r\n\"Hurry,\" said her mother. \"And don't reset the machine.

Maryn stabbed one of the buttons, and the discreetly hidden door by the bed opened up. Out rumbled the life-like rolov, and Maryn sat it on the bed, swung its feet off the travel platform, and slid the platform back into the closet. She closed the closet door, and worked the controls so that the rolov clumsily got into bed and lay down on its side. This part of the rolov's repertoire was not automatic, and took a certain amount of facility with the control box. Maryn, seeing how awkwardly the rolov got into bed, was grateful she did not have to make it walk anywhere. She stood looking at this model of her present appearance and had to admit that, except for the eyes, it looked lifelike. She laid her hand on its shoulder. It was cold as an oyster.",

X-120  and his kind were the culmination of this primal killer instinct.\r\n\r\nIn the haste of a war-pressed emergency man had not taken the time to refine his last creation, or to calculate its result. And with that misstep man had played his last card on the worn gaming table of earth. That built-in urge to kill men in yellow uniforms had changed, ever so slightly, to an urge to kill - men...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe lumbered forward. A few birds were stirring. Suddenly, almost at his feet, a rabbit darted from the bushes. X-120's long jointed arms swung swiftly. The tiny animal lay crushed upon the ground. Instinctively he stamped upon it, leaving only a bloody trace upon the new grass.\r\n\r\nThen remorse and shame stole over him. He went on silently. Somehow the luster of the day had faded for him. He did not want to kill. Always he was ashamed, after the deed was done. And the age-old question went once more through the steel meshes of his mind: Why had he been made to kill?",

The sun was the source of his energy, even as it had been the source of the fleshy life before him; and with the sun's reappearance he felt new strength coursing through the wires and coils and gears of his complex body.\r\n\r\nHe and his companions were highly developed robots, the last ever to be made by the Earthmen. X-120 consisted of a globe of metal, eight feet in diameter, mounted upon four many-jointed legs. At the top of this globe was a protuberance like a kaiser's helmet which caught and stored his power from the rays of the sun.",

Anyone coming in contact with this would receive a low-voltage jolt that was strong enough to make them want to avoid such contact, much less lean on a vehicle so equipped.\r\n\r\nCity vehicles were allowed to generate much more powerful charges. Unlike private cars and taxis whose repelling nuisance voltage was limited by law, those of fire engines and police cars responding to emergency calls could be cranked up to truly uncomfortable levels. Nobody in their right mind would attempt to get in the way of or hitch a ride on an ambulance with siren wailing.

For five years, she'd been my favorite, and I'd put everything into her I could dream up. In all that time, there'd never been a human being behind her wheel.\r\nNot once.\r\n\"Sally,\" I said, patting her gently, \"meet Mr. Gellhorn.\"\r\nSally's cylinder-purr keyed up a little. I listened carefully for any knocking. Lately, I'd been hearing motor-knock in almost all the cars and changing the gasoline hadn't done a bit of good.

I chauffeured dead lumps of machines that needed a man's hand at their controls every minute. Every year machines like that used to kill tens of thousands of people.\r\nThe automatics fixed that. A positronic brain can react much faster than a human one, of course, and it paid people to keep hands off the controls. You got in, punched your destination and let it go its own way.\r\nWe take it for granted now, but I remember when the first laws came out forcing the old machines off the highways and limiting travel to automatics.

That is, nonluminous bodies, ranging in size from superjovian to asteroidal, are believed to occupy interstellar space in an amount greater by three orders of magnitude than the nuclear-reacting self-luminous bodies called stars. Nevertheless, astronomical distances are such that the probability of an object like this passing near a star is vanishingly small. Indeed, explorers have not come upon many rogues even in mid-space. An actual capture must be so rare that the case you found may well be unique in the galaxy.",

The sudden movement of someone nearby, let alone of the wearer, brings an immediate reply from the nerve-like tissues. A dress can change its color and texture in a few seconds, becoming more decollete at the approach of an eager admirer, more formal at a chance meeting with a bank manager.\r\n\r\nThis sensitivity to mood explains the real popularity of bio-fabrics. Clothes are no longer made from dead fibers of fixed color and texture that can approximate only crudely to the vagrant human figure, but from living tissues that adapt themselves to the contours and personality of the wearer. Other advantages are the continued growth of the materials, fed by the body odours and perspriration of the wearer, the sweet liqueurs distilled from her own pores, and the constant renewal of the fibers, repairing any faults or ladders and eliminating the need for washing.",

Twin \r\neyes of light-beam projectors were \r\nset in the bow, which was cut also \r\nby a vision-plate of fused quartz and \r\nthe nitro-shell gun's tube, successor \r\nto the gun-cast harpoon. \r\n\r\nKen lay full-length in the padded \r\nbody compartment, his feet resting \r\non the controlling bars of the directional planes, hands on the torpoon's \r\nengine levers. A harness was buckled \r\nall around him, to keep him in place. \r\nHis gray eyes, level and sober, \r\npeered through the vision-plate at \r\nthe outer catapult door. \r\n\r\nSuddenly a spot of red light \r\nglowed in it; the door quivered, \r\nswung out. A black tide swirled \r\ninto the chamber. There came the \r\nhiss of released air-pressure, and the \r\nslim undersea steed rocketed out \r\ninto the exterior gloom, her light-beams flashing on and propeller settling into a blur of speed as she was \r\nflung. \r\n\r\nKen turned on her full twenty-four knots, zoomed above the \r\ndark bulk of the slower mother ship, \r\nwhose light-beams flashed across him \r\nfor a second, and then straightened \r\nout in a long, slight-angled dive \r\nafter the great black bodies ahead. \r\n\r\nAware that some strange enemy \r\nwas on their track, the killers had become panicky and were darting away \r\nat their full speed, which was only \r\nslightly under that of the torpoon's \r\nhumming motors, and which at times \r\neven surpassed it. Ken saw that it \r\nlooked like a long chase, and settled \r\nhis lean body as comfortably as he \r\ncould. \r\n\n\n\n(The torpoon)\n",

But the swibble, as a functioning whole, is a manufactured item. The organic tissue is inserted in the master tank and then sealed. I certainly don't repair that; I give it nutriments to restore a proper balance of diet, and I try to deal with parasitic organisms that find their way into it. I try to keep it adjusted and healthy. The balance of the organism, is, of course, totally mechanical.\"\r\n\r\n\t\"The swibble has direct access to human minds?\" Anderson asked, fascinated.\r\n\t\"Naturally.

No mention of it had ever been found in official records, though the two men closest to Adolf Hitler had at various times scribbled cryptic references to the thing, or possibly the person, called Donnersprache. \r\n\r\n Dieter Mainz returned before the major did, lugging an old leather valise that, Kalvin presumed, held the secrets of Donnersprache. Kalvin tried not to stare at it, smiling instead at his companion, who kept jerking his head away from the street to scan the shadows. I think you need not fear for your life,'' Kalvin said, noticing the old man's nervous glances. How important can Donnersprache be, in a time when a radio transmitter can be hidden in the heel of a shoe?  \r\n\r\nCan that transmitter hypnotize ten million listeners?  \r\n\r\nKalvin shrugged. I suppose it depends on what is Mid, he hedged, watching a bulky shadow stroll into the street two hundred meters away. He tensed as the distant stranger began to walk in their direction. This old guy is getting to me, he admitted to himself. No, it does not matter what is said when the machine makes one's words seem absolutely true. What matters is the listener's capacity, and desire, to believe in something. Mainz said it dogmatically, as if lecturing on fundamentals. \r\n\r\nBefore enlisting to avoid the draft and a rifleman's fate in Vietnam, Walter Kalvin had been a mediocre student of rhetoric at NYU. The concept of charisma, the overwhelming power of certain individuals to convince many others, had never seemed so real to him as it did at this moment. Maybe old Mainz himself has charisma, thought Kalvin. He's sure got my nerves twanging. Lord, what if it's a kind of force field, and he has one in his pocket? Chuckling at his own fanciful notion, Kalvin said, Perhaps you will tell me exactly what Donnersprache is, and what it does. ",

For the\r\n fourth-order projector, although utterly useless at the intergalactic distances with which\r\n Seaton was principally concerned, was vastly more powerful than any conceivable\r\n telescope.\r\n  \r\n Driven by the full power of a disintegrating uranium bar, it could hold a projection so\r\n steadily at a distance of twenty light-years that a man could manipulate a welding arc as\r\n surely as though it was upon a bench before him which, in effect, it was-and in cases in\r\n which delicacy of control was not an object, such as the present quest for such vast\r\n masses as planets, the projector was effective over distances of many hundreds of light-\r\n years.\r\n  \r\n Thus it came about that the search for a planetiferous sun near a white dwarf star was\r\n not unduly prolonged, and Skylark Two tore through the empty ether toward it.\r\n\r\nClose enough so that the projector could reveal details, Seaton drove projections of all\r\nPage 173 four voyagers down into the atmosphere of the first planet at hand. That atmosphere\r\n was heavy and of a pronounced greenish-yellow cast, and through it that fervent sun\r\n poured down a flood of lurid light upon a peculiarly dead and barren ground-but yet a\r\n ground upon which grew isolated clumps of a livid and monstrous vegetation.\r\n  \r\n \"Of course detailed analysis at this distance is impossible, but what do you make of it,\r\n Dick?\" asked Crane. \"In all our travels, this is only the second time we have encountered\r\n such an atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and that's exactly twice too many.\" Seaton, at the spectroscope, was scowling in\r\n thought. \"Chlorin, all right, with some fluorin and strong traces of oxide of nitrogen,\r\n nitrosyl chloride, and so on-just about like that one we saw in our own galaxy that time. I\r\n thought then and have thought ever since that there was something decidedly fishy about\r\n that planet, and I think there's something equally screwy about this one.\"",

He scrambled to his feet, a \r\nlanky lad, anxious to please a man with stars on his \r\nshoulder. \r\n\r\nHe beckoned and crossed the field toward a bee- \r\nwing, I following. \r\n\r\nIn a moment I was in possession of the craft, and \r\nno hand to stay me. I leaped aboard, stood before \r\nthe control panel, and worked the levers. The elliptical wings of my craft began to beat the air rapidly, \r\nuntil they were a blur to my sight; until they made \r\nsuch deep, roaring buzz that sound of the outside world \r\nwas gone entirely. \r\n\r\nExultantly, I strained my eyes out over Cammint. \r\nEmpty, no staying hand! Good enough! But wait, \r\nwhat was that? \r\n\r\nAcross at the entrance, a harran officer came \r\nrunning through, waving his arms. \r\n\r\nThe game was up? No, by God! and I rammed \r\nhome the final plunger, and the bee-wing took off \r\nflapping up into the thin air and forward with such \r\nspeed that in a matter of seconds Cammint was a dot \r\nof light in the darkness, and the city of Jador was \r\nsprawled in fantastic shadows below. \r\n\r\nI went blind, without lights, never knowing when \r\nsome similar craft might blunder out of the encircling \r\ndarkness full tilt into me. \r\n\r\nI set my course for the Royal Palace, and had my \r\nforward needle guns set for any who dared offer me \r\nhindrance. \r\n\r\n(* The bee-wing is the airplane of Mars. It is an ancient invention, and the only fuel possible for its operation is radium, rapidly becoming the scarcest of Martian elements.

                    "excerpt": "About a year and a half after Hilary's departure into trackless space, a huge flat diskoid came hovering to the ground near Great New York. It carried a party of Mercutians on a friendly exploration, so they said, once communication could be established between Earth linguists and themselves. They were welcomed, made much of. They seemed friendly enough. At their own request they were whirled over the Earth in Earth planes on a tour of inspection.\r\n\r\nWhen they departed, with much protestation of friendship, they assured President Peabody they would return some day, they and others of their race. Just what hidden threat there was in that promise, no one on Earth realized. It was taken at face value.\r\n\r\nJust a year later, almost to the day, the by this time familiar diskoid was seen hovering once more over Great New York. The Mercutians were returning. The people of New York suspected nothing. No troops were rushed to the scene to repel invasion; no guns were trained on the space ship. It was just another friendly visit, and hurried preparations were commenced for a rousing welcome on their landing.\r\n\r\nWhat New York did not know was that simultaneously with the appearance of the Mercutian flier over their city, a hundred others were even then hovering over the strategic capitals of the world. The first Mercutian ambassadors had put to good advantage that hurried tour of inspection.\r\n\r\nNo one was alarmed. Each capital city thought itself signally honored by the reappearance of the lone Mercutian over it. The plan was clever, the timing perfect.\r\n\r\nAt a signal flashed through the ether, things started happening.\r\n\r\nThe great diskoids, hovering high in the stratosphere, suddenly blazed into blinding light. To the dazzled onlookers below, a new sun seemed to have been born. A truncated cone of flame leaped downward. The diskoid was the apex, the spreading base all of Great New York. The sheeted brilliance enveloped the doomed city. It was a holocaust. New York became a roaring furnace. Stone and steel heated to incandescence.\r\n\r\nThe affrighted people had no chance for their lives. Like moths in a flame they died on the streets, in the ovens of their homes, in the steaming rivers into which they had thrown themselves to escape the awful heat. There were few survivors, only those who happened to be inside the giant skyscrapers, protected by many thicknesses of crystal and steel... \r\n\r\nBut the Earthmen did not have a chance. The great sinister diskoids moved methodically over the Earth, high in the stratosphere, where the futile Earth planes could not reach them, and sent the terrible blaze of destruction down unerringly upon armies, cities, towns.\r\n\r\nIt was over soon. One after another, the Earth governments capitulated. America was the last\u0097old Amos Peabody vowed he would rather go down to utter destruction than yield\u0097but he was out-voted in Council. It was pure slaughter otherwise, without a chance to fight back...\r\n\r\n\"How do the diskoids operate?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Something like the sun rays on the one-man fliers,\" Grim told him, \"only vastly more powerful. They are not limited in range, for one thing. It took only one, fifty miles up in the stratosphere, to destroy all New York. I saw the one that first spied on the Earth. It was about five hundred feet in diameter, made of the same vitreous material, and shaped like a huge lens. No doubt, besides being a space ship, it is just that. The sun's light flashes through it, is rearranged into terrible burning rays, and sears all in its path.\"",

A hasty glance around inside showed that nothing had been touched. Everything was orderly, methodical, just as he had left it.\r\n\r\nGrim and Wat examined with interest the banked controls, the polarization apparatus that set up repulsion waves and literally kicked the ship out into space away from the planet against which it had been set...\r\n\r\nHe set the polarization controls so that the mere pulling of a switch would send the flier careening off into space.

Its smooth gray-gleaming surface was devoid of wings or other lifting devices. Only a fan-shaped fin projected from the stern like the tail of a fish. The cockpit, if such it could be called, was tiny, just ample enough to accommodate the Mercutian's girth. The sunlight dazzled back from a bewildering jumble of tiny lenses inset in the instrument board. Arranged along the hull, on either side, were larger disks of the same quartz-like material.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get away in the flier,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Can't,\" Grim said. \"Those lenses you see on the instrument board are the controls. No one knows how to operate them except the Mercutians. Our people managed to capture a few, but couldn't do a thing with them.\"\r\n\r\nHilary stared at the motionless flier with interest. \"What are those round glass disks stretched along the hull in a double row?\" he asked. \"They look like burning glasses.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what they are,\" said Grim sadly. \"The top row are sun-lenses, that throw a terrible ray for a distance of two to three hundred feet. Melts everything in its path\u0097men trees, rocks even. You saw one in action in the sun-tube with which poor old Peabody was cut in half. The lower row of lenses on the flier are search beams.\"\r\n\r\n\"Search beams?\" Hilary echoed inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. They act like X-rays, more powerful though, and with the further property of rendering everything they touch transparently crystal for depths of ten to fifteen feet. Lead is the only element they can not penetrate. Another secret our scientists can not fathom, so they talk learnedly about the stream of rays polarizing the structure of matter along a uniaxis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't those lenses be duplicated, and turned as weapons against the Mercutians?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. They are made of a peculiar vitreous material native to Mercury.\"\r\n\r\n\"And no one has found out the principle on which they work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there have been theories. We haven't many scientists left, you know. But the most popular one is that these lenses have the power of concentrating the rays of the sun to an almost infinite degree, and then spreading them out again, each individual beam with the concentrated energy of the whole. Some new way of rearranging quanta of energy.\"",

Surprised, the men turned to her.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" she said breathlessly. \"Father had been working on it for the longest time. It was a machine to control weather. Something to do with broadcasting tremendously high voltages, ionizing the air and causing rain clouds to form or reversing the process and scattering clouds back into thin air. This was the Master Machine. All over the Earth, at spaced distances, were smaller replicas, substations, controlled from this one. He had great hopes of furnishing equable weather to all the Earth. It was just completed, when....\" She trailed off...\r\n\r\nThere were about a dozen Mercutians in the long laboratory, and each had a sun-tube dangling from his belt, ready at hand. The laboratory was crowded with apparatus, but what had drawn Hilary's attention was a gigantic gleaming metallic sphere set up prominently in the center of the room. Protruding from it at all angles were great quartz tubes, through which a blue light pulsed and flamed. It was connected by huge cables to a spark-bathed dynamo. Other cables writhed through the translucent ceiling. The weather machine!",

As Hughes worked the keyboard in front of him, the organ turned so that they were looking at its underside. \"There it is,\" Charley Hughes said. It had a fine network of silver wires training from it, but seemed normal.\r\n\r\n\"The George Jordan brain,\" Innis said. \"With attachments. Very nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me show you a few things,\" Charley Huges said. As he typed, then turned the plastic mouse beside the console, the convoluted gray cortex became transparent, revealing red, blue, and green color-coded structures within. Hughes reached into the center of the brain and clinched his fist inside a blue area at the top of the spinal cord. \"Here is where the electrical connections turn biological - those little nodes along the pseudo-neurons are the bioprocessors, and they wire into the so-called 'r-complex' - which we inherited from our reptillian forefathers. The pseudo-neurons continue into the limbic system... and that's where emotion enters in. But there is further involvement to the neocortex through the RAS, the reticular activating system, and the corpus collosum. There are also connections to the optic nerve.\"",

It might even look something like its owner. \r\n\r\nHer date doesn't look half bad himself. The other girl is a Brandy. Her date is a Clint. Brandy and Clint are both popular, off-the-shelf models. When white trash high school girls are going on a date in the Metaverse, they invariably run down to the computer-games section of the local Wal-Mart and buy a copy of Brandy. The user can select three breast sizes: improbable, impossible, and ludicrous. Brandy has a limited repertoire of facial expressions: cute and pouty; cute and sultry; perky and interested; smiling and receptive; cute and spacy. Her eyelashes are half an inch long, and the software isso cheap that they are rendered as solid ebony chips. When a Brandy flutters her eyelashes, you can almost feel the breeze. Clint is just the male counterpart of Brandy. He is craggy and handsome and has an extremely limited range of facial expressions.",

It whirs around so quickly that the individual tubes are difficult to make out... The device is attached to a wrist-thick bundle of black tubes and cables that snake down into the large suitcase...

Each spoke telescopes into five sections. On the end is a squat foot, rubber tread on the bottom, swiveling on a ball joint. As the wheel rolls, the feet plant themselves one at a time, almost glomming into one continuous tire. If you surf over a bump, the spokes contract to roll over it.  If you surf over a pothole, the rubber prongs probe its asphalt depths. Either way, the shock is thereby absorbed, no thuds, smacks, vibrations, or clunks will make their way into the plank or the Converse hightops with which you tread it. The ad was right - you cannot be a professional road surfer without smartwheels.",

A technique that would produce, if not model citizens, at least reasonably honest ones. That research was still continuing, but for the last year the Institute had concentrated on developing Softlight.\r\n\r\nIt had been the idea of Doctor Michael Elliot, a neurologist who had been studying memory retention to see how long the rectification commands would last.\r\n\r\nWhat his research uncovered was the amnesia mechanism, the method by which grey cells discard the unwanted memories of each day's events, preventing the brain from being cluttered up with a billion irrelevant details. Elliot isolated the governing neurological code and managed to adapt the laser imprint technique to transmit the sequence throughout the brain. Softlight: the total erasure of memory and behaviour patterns. Personality death.\r\n\r\nAnyone committing a capital crime could be mentally executed, leaving behind a perfectly viable body; an adult infant ready to be named, educated, and returned to the world as fully functional members of society. Capital punishment without death. For the PC politicians of the Brussels Federal Assembly it was a dream solution...\r\n\r\nOfficially it was laboratory complex seven. But Douglas knew the Institute staff had taken to calling it the Light Chamber; and the press had somehow got hold of that title. It resembled a dental surgery, with a bulky hydraulic chair in the middle of the floor, a glass-topped desk, several cabinets of electronic equipment, and two voice-activated computer terminals. The Softlight imprinter was a triple-segment metal arm standing next to the chair; it ended in a bulbous plastic strip moulded to fit over the eyes like an optician's mask.",

Riggs\u0092 ship was the Little Falls, laden with fuel for the atomic motors of the robot observatories planted on thirty different planets of several nearby suns, and a huge supply of photographic plates to replenish the nearly exhausted magazines of the telescopic cameras. \r\n\r\nPlaced in many cases on planets where men could not have survived continued existence, the observatories on the planets of the nearer stars were serviced once every three terrestrial years. The exposed plates from the telescopes were removed, developed in the service ship as it sped through the endless wastes of space to its next destination, and run through moving-picture cameras to detect any astronomical occurrences recorded on them. \r\n\r\nSince most of the cameras exposed plates only every few days, or at the most, a small number a day, it was a matter of but little time to run the film at projection speed through a moving-picture projector and look for such novae and comets as were recorded in the interval. The more detailed graphs collected by cosmic-ray detectors, and so on, were brought back to Earth for more careful and detailed scrutiny by specialized experts. \r\n",

It came from the night-side, and they could not see where it was launched, though they could make excellent guesses. They got a single guided missile ready to crash it if necessary.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't necessary. The bomb from Earth detonated 300 miles below the\r\nartificial satellite. Its proximity fuse, sending out small radar-type waves, had them reflected back by an empty sardine can  thrown away from the Platform by Mike Scandia forty-some hours ago. The sardine can had been traveling in its own private orbit ever since. The effect of Mike's muscles had not been to send it \r\nback to Earth, but to change the center of the circular orbit in which it floated. Sometimes it floated above the Platform\u0097that was on one side of Earth\u0097and sometimes below it. It was about 300 miles under the Platform when it reflected urgent, squealing radar frequency waves to a complex proximity fuse in the climbing rocket. The rocket couldn't tell the difference between a sardine can and a Space Platform.",

When he lifted his right foot, he had to turn his left slightly inward. His arms tried to float absurdly upward. When he was in motion and essayed to pause, his whole body tended to continue forward with a sedate toppling motion that brought him down flat on his face. He had to put one foot forward to check himself. He seemed to have no sense of balance. When he stood still\u0097his stomach queasy because of weightlessness\u0097he found himself tilting undignifiedly forward or back\u0097or, with equal unpredictability, sidewise.

It looked like the magnified top half of a loaf of baker's bread, painted gray and equipped with an air-scoop in front and a plastic bubble for a pilot. It howled like a lost baby dragon, its flat underside tilted up and up until it was almost vertical. It had no wings, but a blue-white flame spurted out of its rear, wobbling from side to side for reasons best known to itself. It was a pushpot, which could not possibly be called a jet plane because it could not possibly fly. Only it did. \r\n\r\nIt settled down on its flame-spouting tail, and the sparse vegetation burst into smoky flame and shriveled, and the thing \u0097 still shrieking like a fog-horn in a tunnel \u0097 flopped flat forward with a resounding clank! It was abruptly silent.\r\n\r\nBut the total noise was not lessened. Another pushpot came soaring wildly into view, making hysterical outcries. It touched and banged violently to earth. Others appeared in the air beyond the construction Shed. One flopped so hard on landing that its tail rose in the air and it attempted a somersault. It made ten times more noise than before \u0097 the flame from its tail making wild gyrations \u0097 and flopped back again with a crash. Two others rolled over on their sides after touching ground. One ended up on its back like a tumble-bug, wriggling.\r\n\r\nThey seemed to land by hundreds, but their number was actually in dozens. It was not until the last one was down that Joe could make himself heard. The pushpots were jet motors in frames and metal skin, with built-in jato rocket tubes besides their engines. On the ground they were quite helpless. In the air they were unbelievably clumsy. They were actually balanced and steered by vanes in the blasts of their jets, and they combined the absolute maximum of sheer thrust with the irreducible minimum of flyability.\r\n\r\n... A gigantic crane-truck came in through the wide doorway. It dangled a pushpot. It rolled over to the launching cage in which the spaceship lay and set the unwieldy metal object against that cage. There was a clank as the pushpot caught hold of the magnetic grapples. The crane went out again, passing a second crane carrying a second pushpot. The second beetle-like thing was presented to the cage. It stuck fast. The crane went out for more.",

It was a space flight simulator\u0097a descendant of the Link trainer which once taught plane pilots how to fly. But this offered the problems and the sensations of rocketship control, and for many hours every day Joe and the three members of his crew had labored in it. The simulator duplicated every sight and sound and feeling\u0097all but heavy acceleration\u0097to be experienced in the take-off of a rocketship to space. The similitude of flight was utterly convincing. Sometimes it was appallingly so when emergencies and catastrophes and calamities were staged in horrifying detail for them to learn to respond to. In six weeks they'd learned how to handle a spaceship so far as anybody could learn on solid ground\u0097if the simulator was correctly built. Nobody could be sure about that.

When he was actually at the base of its wall, it seemed to fill half the firmament and more than half the horizon. He went in, and felt self-conscious when the guard's eyes fell on his uniform. There was a tiny vestibule. Then he was in the Shed itself, and it was enormous.\r\n\r\nThere were acres of wood-block flooring. There was a vast, steel-girdered arching roof which was fifty stories high in the center. All this size had been needed when the Space Platform was being built. Men on the far side were merely specks, and the rows of windows to admit light usually did no more than make a gray twilight inside. But there was light enough today. To the east the Shed's wall was split from top to bottom. A colossal triangular gore had been loosened and thrust out and rolled aside, and a doorway a hundred and fifty feet wide let in the sunshine.

It stayed in its saucer because of magnets in both plastic articles. The saucer stayed on the table because the table was magnetic, too.

When one put his lips to the proper edge, a part of the cover yielded as the cup was squeezed. The far side of the cup was flexible.

One is by suspended animation as you have suggested, the other is by generation ship, which this is. We have combined both and so avoided the weaknesses inherent in either. The generation ship depends on new blood replacing the old, but the danger is that the new blood will forget what it should remember. Sixteen generations is a long time, Jay. Even with continual use of educational tapes it is still hard for some people to accept the fact that the Ship is nothing but a metal can drifting in the void. To them the Ship is the universe and they just can't imagine anything possibly being bigger. The Deep-freeze method is just as bad. Then the personnel have to rely wholly on automatic machinery, even as we do, but they are far more vulnerable than a generation ship could ever be. And there is another thing. We still aren't certain that they will be fertile after deep-freeze. The animals are, the men and women should be, but no one has ever rested in suspended animation for more than three hundred years before. It was a chance we dared not take.\u0092",

He favored this spot because from it he could see the steel stilts and guide rings of the Chicago, Springfield, & Earthport Ring Road emerge from a slash in the ridge to his right. There was a guide ring at the mouth of the cut, a great steel hoop twenty feet high. A pair of stilt-like tripods supported another ring a hundred feet out from the cut. A third and last ring, its stilts more than a hundred feet high to keep it level with the others, lay west of him where the ground dropped still more sharply into the valley below. Half way up it he could see the power-link antenna pointing across the gap. On his left the guides of the C.S.&E. picked up again on the far side of the gap. The entering ring was larger to allow for maximum windage deviation; on its stilts was the receptor antenna for the power link. That ridge was steeper; there was only one more ring before the road disappeared into a tunnel. He had read that, on the Moon, entrance rings were no larger than pass-along rings, since there was never any wind to cause variation in ballistic. When he was a child this entrance ring had been slightly smaller and, during an unprecedented windstorm, a train had struck the ring and produced an unbelievable wreck, with more than four hundred people killed. He had not seen it and his father had not allowed him to poke around afterwards because of the carnage, but the scar of it could still be seen on the lefthand ridge, a darker green than the rest.",

He raised his right arm, where the blunt stub of his own cannon projected from beneath the specially adapted sleeve of his coat. ... It was one of the Taken. A boy-child, perhaps ten years old, with long blond hair down to its shoulders and wearing a simple blue smock. Its feet were bare. It gazed innocently at them from a distance of a few dozen feet. ... Bane raised his cannon. \"Get out of my city,\" he told it, and fired. The Taken dodged the first blast, its expression of fresh-faced youth dissolving into snarling animal hatred as it attacked. It ran at them with teeth bared, fingers held out before it like claws, screeching. The soldier panicked, squeezing off a shot too early. The Taken leaped over the path of the soldier's bolt and landed on him, hands clamped around his bald head. The soldier dropped without a sound. The mere touch of a Taken meant death. Bane didn't miss a second time. He caught the Taken full in the chest as it bunched to spring, and it crumpled.",

At first, they seemed like smooth metal balls about two feet in diameter, with four red lenses that looked uncomfortably like eyes spaced around their upper hemisphere. As Moa watched, they rose a little way, until they were hovering a few inches above the water. They swivelled towards the drones that were speeding across the waves. \r\n\"How many do you see?\" Kittiwake asked. \"Three?\" \r\n\"That's right. Three,\" Moa said. ... \r\n\r\nThey shot across the sea, raising fins of spume behind them. As they went, a multitude of blades unfolded from their round bodies and began to spin. By the time they reached the drones, each one was a whirling blur of sharp edges. They smashed into their targets like cannonballs, reducing them to splinters in moments. Then they sped off on a new course. Another drone was torn to shreds, throwing bits of wood in the air...and the Skimmers stopped, coming to a dead halt. ... \r\n\"They made it,\" Moa breathed.

Some day, I hope, there'll be a billion like him, and we'll really have a Mnemonic Service.\r\n\"All their lives,\" Sheffield went on, \"they do nothing but read, look, and listen. And train to do that better and more efficiently. It doesn't matter what data they collect. It doesn't have to have obvious sense or obvious significance. It doesn't matter if any man in the Service wants to spend a week going over the records of the space-polo teams of the Canopus Sector for the last century. Any datum may be useful some day. That's the fundamental axiom.\r\n\"Every once in a while, one of the Service may correlate across a gap no machine could possibly manage. The machine would fail because no one machine is likely to possess those two pieces of thoroughly unconnected information; or else, if the machine does have it, no man would be insane enough to ask the right question.

He flexed his legs, the massive flukes thrust back jerkily in response, and his machine immediately rolled over and sank.\r\n\r\nJacob tried to correct but overcompensated, making the waldo tumble even worse. The beating of his fins momentarily made the area around him a churning mass of bubbles, until patiently, by trial and error, he got himself righted.\r\n\r\nHe pushed off again, carefully, to get some headway, then arched his back and kicked out. The waldo responded with a great tail-slashing leap into the air.\r\n\r\nThe dolphin was almost a kilometer off. As he reached the top of his arc, Jacob saw her fall gracefully from a height of ten meters to slice smoothly into the swell below.\r\n\r\nHe pointed his helmet beak at the water and the sea came at him like a green wall. The impact made his helmet ring as he tore through tendrils of floating kelp, sending a golden Garibaldi darting away in panic as he drove downwards.\r\n\r\nHe was going in too steep. He swore and kicked twice to straighten out. The machine's massive metal flukes beat at the water to the rhythmic push of his feet, each beat sending a tremor up his spine, pressing him against the suit's heavy padding. When the time was right, he arched and kicked again. The machine ripped out of the water.\r\n\r\nSunlight flashed like a missile in his left window, its glare drowning the dim glow of his tiny instrument panel. The helmet computer chuckled softly as he twisted, beak down, to crash into the bright water once again.",

Moving very gently\u0097though there were shock absorbers between the control capsule and the delicate rigging, he was determined to run no risks\u0097Merton stationed himself at the periscope.\r\n\n\n\n(Periscope of solar yacht)\n\r\nThere they were, looking like strange silver flowers planted in the dark fields of space. The nearest, South America\u0092s Santa Maria, was only fifty miles away; it bore a close resemblance to a boy\u0092s kite, but a kite more than a mile on a side. Farther away, the University of Astrograd\u0092s Lebedev looked like a Maltese cross; the sails that formed the four arms could apparently be tilted for steering purposes. In contrast, the Federation of Australasia\u0092s Woomera was a simple parachute, four miles in circumference. General Spacecraft\u0092s Arachne, as its name suggested, looked like a spiderweb, and had been built on the same principles, by robot shuttles spiraling out from a central point. Eurospace Corporation\u0092s Gossamer was an identical design, on a slightly smaller scale. And the Republic of Mars\u0092s Sunbeam was a flat ring, with a half-mile-wide hole in the center, spinning slowly, so that centrifugal force gave it stiffness. That was an old idea, but no one had ever made it work; and Merton was fairly sure that the colonials would be in trouble when they started to turn.\r\nThat would not be for another six hours, when the yachts had moved along the first quarter of their slow and stately twenty-four-hour orbit. Here at the beginning of the race, they were all heading directly away from the Sun\u0097running, as it were, before the solar wind. One had to make the most of this lap, before the boats swung around to the other side of Earth and then started to head back into the Sun.\r\nTime, Merton told himself, for the first check, while he had no navigational worries. With the periscope, he made a careful examination of the sail, concentrating on the points where the rigging was attached to it. The shroud lines\u0097narrow bands of unsilvered plastic film\u0097would have been completely invisible had they not been coated with fluorescent paint. Now they were taut lines of colored light, dwindling away for hundreds of yards toward that gigantic sail. Each had its own electric windlass, not much bigger than a game fisherman\u0092s reel. The little windlasses were continually turning, playing lines in or out as the autopilot kept the sail trimmed at the correct angle to the Sun.",

                    "excerpt": "...Erich von Harben is something of a scientist and explorer himself, and the last time that I saw him he had just returned from a second expedition into the Wiramwazi Mountains, where he told me that he had discovered a lake-dwelling tribe using canoes made of a metal that was apparently as light as cork and stronger than steel. He brought some samples of the metal back with him...\" \r\n\r\n\"...It is not my intention to weary you with a recital of the details of the organization and equipment of the Pellucidarian expedition, although that portion of it which relates to the search for and discovery of the native mine containing the remarkable metal now known as Harbenite, filled as it was with adventure and excitement, is well worth a volume by itself.\" \r\n\r\n\"...Exhaustive tests were made of the samples of Harbenite brought to Friedrichshafen by Jason Gridley. Plans were drawn, and by the time the shipment of the ore arrived everything was in readiness to commence immediate construction, which was carried on secretly. And six months later, when the O-220, as it was officially known, was ready to take the air, it was generally considered to be nothing more than a new design of the ordinary type of rigid airship, destined to be used as a common carrier upon one of the already numerous commercial airways of Europe. The great cigar-shaped hull of the O-220 was 997 feet in length and 150 feet in diameter. The interior of the hull was divided into six large, air-tight compartments, three of which, running the full length of the ship, were above the medial line and three below. Inside the hull and running along each side of the ship, between the upper and lower vacuum tanks, were long corridors in which were located the engines, motors and pumps, in addition to supplies of gasoline and oil. The internal location of the engine room was made possible by the elimination of fire risk, which is an ever-present source of danger in airships which depend for their lifting power upon hydrogen gas, as well as to the absolutely fireproof construction of the O-220; every part of which, with the exception of a few cabin fittings and furniture, was of Harbenite, this metal being used throughout except for certain bushings and bearings in motors, generators and propellers.",

Inside the hull and running along each side of the ship, between the upper and lower vacuum tanks, were long corridors in which were located the engines, motors and pumps, in addition to supplies of gasoline and oil. The internal location of the engine room was made possible by the elimination of fire risk, which is an ever-present source of danger in airships which depend for their lifting power upon hydrogen gas, as well as to the absolutely fireproof construction of the O-220; every part of which, with the exception of a few cabin fittings and furniture, was of Harbenite, this metal being used throughout except for certain bushings and bearings in motors, generators and propellers. Connecting the port and starboard engine and fuel corridors were two transverse corridors, one forward and one aft, while bisecting these transverse corridors were two climbing shafts extending from the bottom of the ship to the top. The upper end of the forward climbing shaft terminated in a small gun and observation cabin at the top of the ship, along which was a narrow walking-way extending from the forward cabin to a small turret near the tail of the ship, where provision had been made for fixing a machine gun. The main cabin, running along the keel of the ship, was an integral part of the hull, and because of this entirely rigid construction, which eliminated the necessity for cabins suspended below the hull, the O-220 was equipped with landing gear in the form of six, large, heavily tired wheels projecting below the bottom of the main cabin. In the extreme stern of the keel cabin a small scout monoplane was carried in such a way that it could be lowered through the bottom of the ship and launched while the O-220 was in flight. Eight air-cooled motors drove as many propellers, which were arranged in pairs upon either side of the ship and staggered in such a manner that the air from the forward propellers would not interfere with those behind. The engines, developing 5600 horsepower, were capable of driving the ship at a speed of 105 miles per hour. In the O-220 the ordinary axial wire, which passes the whole length of the ship through the center, consisted of a tubular shaft of Harbenite from which smaller tubular braces radiated, like the spokes of a wheel, to the tubular girders, to which the Harbenite plates of the outer envelope were welded. Owing to the extreme lightness of Harbenite, the total weight, of the ship was 75 tons, while the total lift of its vacuum tanks was 225 tons. For purposes of maneuvering the ship and to facilitate landing, each of the vacuum tanks was equipped with a bank of eight air valves operated from the control cabin at the forward end of the keel; while six pumps, three in the starboard and three in the port engine corridors, were designed to expel the air from the tanks when it became necessary to renew the vacuum.",

But I've always heard that, even so, it's dangerous to wander around on the sunward side of Mercury\u0097if a fellow happens to wander too far. Let me see that space armor you use!\"\r\n\r\nJoshua Briggs obeyed promptly, opening a supply cabinet in the wall. Southern took out the vacuum armor hanging there beside several curious umbrella-like sunshades of asbestos fabric. He examined the armor carefully, especially the heavy, insulated boots. It was all standard equipment, exactly like his own space suit...\r\n\r\nPresently, scientist and outlaw were plodding across the desert toward the fuel vault two miles away. In addition to their asbestos sunshades, they carried slings of metal webwork at their belts, with which to transport the small drums of compact but fearfully powerful atomic fuel, which they were going to bring back for Southern's space ship.\r\n\r\nVince Southern felt cool and comfortable in his space suit, shaded as it was by the asbestos shield he held over his helmet. This much was all logical and in accord with science. The direct rays of the sun were screened away from him, and the Mercurian air, being extremely thin, could not transmit much heat to his armor.",

I sat before the mirror\r\nthat represented the electric eye of the robot, and\r\nby various levers moved \u0093No. 7\u0094 to take a look at the temperature of the electric furnace for repulsion tube No. 3. Everything was functioning perfectly. I continued\r\nto do routine work relative to the operation of\r\nthe repulsion tube...\r\n\r\nAs my robot straightened up from depositing some\r\nhuge balance weights on the floor, I saw with horror\r\nthat a polonium tube leading to the great discharger had snapped, pouring the precious Martian metal on\r\nthe floor. Immediately, the dial on the wall above me\r\nshowed that the great disk had already taken on a\r\nlist, and was beginning to descend slightly. \u0093Increase your voltage and polonium flow, men,\r\nI\u0092m shutting my discharger off. Polonium tube snapped !\u0094 \r\n\r\nKnowing full well that the other repulsors could not\r\nstand the added strain indefinitely, I set No. 7 to work swiftly to close off the voltage and metal flow, and replace the broken tube. Conversation ceased;\r\nthe others turning grim faces to their work, and working\r\nrapidly and surely. The list was corrected but\r\nstill the disk continued to descend. With my heart pounding in my ears, it seemed an eternity to cut out\r\nthe tube. Yet, it was delicate work and had to be done with extreme care. Even in this crucial moment\r\nI marveled at the delicacy with which the automaton\r\nhandled the tube under my control. I watched metal hands carefully place the tube in its section. As soon\r\nas it was safe, the polonium began to flow again, and\r\nthe discharger was turned on. Slowly, the instruments\r\nindicated that the descent of the disk was checked, and\r\nthat it began to assume a normal elevation again after having fallen a thousand feet. ",

                    "excerpt": "Sprinkled about the bottom of this valley were a few wooden dwelling-houses and workshops, and in the centre was a huge shed, or rather an enclosure now, for its roof had been taken off.\r\n\r\nIn this lay, like a ship in a graving-dock, a long, narrow, grey-painted vessel almost exactly like a sea-going ship, save for the fact that she had no funnel, and that her three masts, Instead of yards, each carried a horizontal fan-wheel, while from each of her sides projected, level with the deck, a plane twice the width of the deck and nearly as long as the vessel herself.\r\n\r\nThey entered the enclosure and walked round the hull. This was seventy feet long and twelve wide amidships, and save for size it was the exact counterpart of the model already described.\r\n\r\n...Colston made his first inspection of the interior of the air-ship, under the guidance of her creator. What struck him most at first sight was the apparent inadequacy of the machinery to the attainment of the tremendous speed at which Arnold had promised they should travel.\r\n\nThere were four somewhat insignificant-looking engines in all. Of these, one drove the stern propeller, one the side propellers, and two the fan-wheels on the masts. He learnt as soon as the voyage began, that, by a very simple switch arrangement, the power of the whole four engines could be concentrated on the propellers; for, once in the air, the lifting wheels were dispensed with and lowered on deck, and the ship was entirely sustained by the pressure of the air under her planes.\n\r\nThere was not an ounce of superfluous wood or metal about the beautifully constructed craft, but for all that she was complete in every detail, and the accommodation she had for crew and passengers was perfectly comfortable, and in some respects cosy in the extreme. Forward there was a spacious cabin with berths for six men, and aft there were separate cabins for six people, and a central saloon for common use.\r\n\r\nOn deck there were three structures, a sort of little conning tower forward, a wheel-house aft, and a deck saloon amidships. All these were, of course, so constructed as to offer the least possible resistance to the wind, or rather the current created by the vessel herself when flying through the air at a speed greater than that of the hurricane itself.\r\n\r\nAll were closely windowed with toughened glass, for it is hardly necessary to say that, but for such a protection, every one who appeared above the level of the deck would be almost instantly suffocated, if not whirled overboard, by the rush of air when the ship was going at full speed. Her armament consisted of four long, slender cannon, two pointing over the bows, and two over the stern.\r\n\r\n...While the stores were being put on board, Arnold made a careful examination of every part of the machinery, and then of the whole vessel, in order to assure himself that everything was in perfect order. This done, he gave his final instructions to those of the little community who were left behind to await the arrival of the steamer, and as the sun sank behind the western ridges of the island, he went on board the Ariel with Colston, took his place at the wheel, and ordered the fan-wheels to be set in motion.\r\n\r\nColston was standing by the open door of the wheel-house as Arnold communicated his order to the engine-room by pressing an electric button, one of four in a little square of mahogany in front of the wheel.\r\n\r\nThere was no vibration or grinding, as would have been the case in starting a steamer, but only a soft whirring humming sound, that rose several degrees in pitch as the engines gained speed, and the fan-wheels revolved faster and faster until they sang in the air, and the Ariel rose without a jar or a tremor from the ground, slowly at first, and then more and more swiftly, until Colston saw the ground sinking rapidly beneath him, and the island growing smaller and smaller, until it looked like a little patch on the dark grey water of the sea.",

After this they went to the wheel-house, where Arnold inclined the planes at a sharper angle, and sent the Ariel flying up into the sky, until the barometer showed an elevation of three thousand feet.\r\n\r\nThen he signalled to the engine-room, the fan-wheels rose from the deck, as if by their own volition, and, as soon as they reached their places, began to spin round faster and faster, until Colston could again hear the high-pitched singing sound that he had heard as the Ariel rose from Drumcraig Island.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the speed of the vessel rapidly decreased; the side propellers ceased working, and the stern-screw revolved more and more slowly, until the speed came down to about thirty miles an hour.\r\n\r\nBy this time the great fortress of Kronstadt could be distinctly seen lying upon its island, like some huge watch-dog crouched at the entrance to his master's house, guarding the way to St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Arnold, \"we can go outside without any fear of being blown off into space.\" They went out and walked forward to the bow. Arrived there they found two of the men, each with a curious-looking shell in his arms. The projectiles were about two feet long and six inches in diameter, and were, as Arnold told Colston, constructed of papier-mache\u0301. There were three blades projecting from the outside, and running spirally from the point to the butt. These fitted into grooves in the inside of the cannon, which were really huge air-guns twenty feet long, including the air-chamber at the breech.\r\n\r\nThe projectiles were placed in position, the breeches of the guns closed, and a minute later the air-chambers were filled with air at a pressure of two hundred atmospheres, pumped from the forward engines through pipes leading up to the guns for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Arnold, \"we're ready! Meanwhile you two can go and load the two after guns...\"\r\n\r\n\"Just take a look down with your glasses and see if they see us. I expect they do by this time.\"\r\n\r\nColston put his field-glass to his eyes, and looked down at the fortress, which was now only six or seven miles ahead.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"at any rate I can see a lot of little figures running about on the roof of one of the ramparts, which I suppose are soldiers. What's the range of your gun? I should say the fortress is about six miles off now.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can hit it from here, if you like,\" replied Arnold, \"and if we were a thousand feet higher I could send a shell into Petersburg. See! there is the City of Palaces. Away yonder in the distance you can just see the sun shining on the houses. We could see it quite plainly if it wasn't for the haze that seems to be lying over the Neva.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking, Arnold trained the gun according to a scale on a curved steel rod which passed through a screw socket in the breech of the piece.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he said. \"Watch!\"\r\n\r\nHe pressed a button on the top of the breech. There was a sharp but not very loud sound as the compressed air was released; something rushed out of the muzzle of the gun, and a few seconds later, Colston could see the missile boring its way through the air, and pursuing a slanting but perfectly direct path for the centre of the fortress.\r\n\r\nA second later it struck. He could see a bright greenish flash as it smote the steel roof of the central fort. Then the fort seemed to crumble up and dissolve into fragments, and a few moments later a dull report floated up into the sky mingled, as he thought, with screams of human agony.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he stared in silence through the glasses, then he turned to Arnold and said in a voice that trembled with violent emotion --\r\n\r\n\"Good God, that is awful! The whole of the centre citadel is gone as though it had been swept off the face of the earth. I can hardly see even the ruins of it. Surely that's murder rather than war!\"\r\n\r\n\"No more murder than the use of torpedoes in naval warfare, as far as I can see,\" replied Arnold coolly. \"Remember, too,\" he continued in a sterner tone, \"that fortress belongs to the power that flogged Radna and has captured Natasha. Come, let's see what execution you can do.\" ",

                    "excerpt": "\"There is, however, another most important element which has now for the first time been introduced into warfare, and which, although it is most unhappily arrayed amongst the forces opposed to our own country and her gallant allies, it would be both idle and most imprudent to ignore. We refer of course, to the two fleets of war-balloons, or, as it would be more correct to call them, navigable aerostats, possessed by France and Russia.\r\n\r\n\"So tremendous has been the influence which these terrible inventions have exercised upon the course of the war, that we are not transgressing the bounds of sober truth when we say that they have utterly disconcerted and brought to nought the highest strategy and the most skilfully devised plans of the brilliant array of masters of the military art whose presence adorns the ranks and enlightens the councils of the Alliance.\r\n\r\n\"Since the day when the Russians crossed the German and Austrian frontiers, and the troops of France and Italy simultaneously flung themselves across the western frontiers of Germany and through the passes of the Tyrol, their progress, unparalleled in rapidity even by the marvellous marches of Napoleon, has been marked, not by what we have hitherto been accustomed to call battles, but rather by a series of colossal butcheries.\r\n\r\n\"In every case of any moment the method of procedure on the part of the attacking forces has been the same, and, with the deepest regret we confess it, it has been marked with the same unvarying success. Whenever a large army has been set in motion upon a predetermined point of attack, whether a fortress, an entrenched camp, or a strongly occupied position in the field, a squadron of aerostats has winged its way through the air under cover of the darkness of night, and silently and unperceived has marked the disposition of forces, the approximate strength of the army or the position to be attacked, and, as far as they were observable, the points upon which the attack could be most favourably delivered. Then they have returned with their priceless information, and, according to it, the assailants have been able, in every case so far, to make their assault where least expected, and to make it, moreover, upon an already partially demoralised force.\r\n\r\n\"From the detailed descriptions which we have already published of battles and sieges, or rather of the storming of great fortresses, it will be remembered that every assault on the part of the troops of the League has been preceded by a preliminary and irresistible attack from the clouds.\r\n\r\n\"The aerostats have stationed themselves at great elevations over the ramparts of fortresses and the bivouacs of armies, and have rained down a hail of dynamite, melinite, fire-shells and cyanogen poison-grenades, which have at once put guns out of action, blown up magazines, rendered fortifications untenable, and rent masses of infantry and squadrons of cavalry into demoralised fragments, before they had the time or the opportunity to strike a blow in reply. Then upon these silenced batteries, these wrecked fortifications, and these demoralised brigades, there has poured a storm of artillery fire from the untouched enemy, advancing in perfect order, and inspired with high-spirited confidence, which has been irresistibly opposed to the demoralisation of their enemies.\r\n\r\n\"Is it any wonder, or any disgrace, to the defeated, that under such novel and appalling conditions the orderly and disciplined onslaughts of the legions of the League have in almost every case been completely successful? The sober truth is that the invention and employment of these devastating appliances have completely altered the face of the field of battle and the conditions of modern warfare. It is not in human valour, no matter how heroic or self-devoted it may be, to oppose itself with anything like confidence to an enemy which strikes from the skies, and cannot be struck in return.",

Strictly speaking, of course, there is no such thing as positive cold, only absence of heat. The theory generally accepted now is that in some unexplained manner the ray had the power of instantly sucking away the heat of anything it touched.\r\n\r\nCertain it was that the ray was a terrible weapon. Beneath it, flesh and blood froze immediately into black hard lumps, metal cracked, trees and plants shriveled instantly...\r\n\r\nIt seems that as the Cold Ray swept around the city, it crossed, ever and again. the city's harbor and the sea outside.

It was too\r\nridiculous.\r\nThey were, perhaps, a little smaller than himself, and black as the ace of\r\nspades, and they wore skin-tight shorts and vests that were somewhat oversize and both the shorts and vests were the blue of April skies.\r\nBut that was not the worst of it.\r\nThey sat on saddles, with horns in front and stirrups and a sort of bedroll\r\ntied on the back, but they had no horses.\r\nThe saddles floated in the air, with stirrups about three feet above the\r\nground and the aliens sat easily in the saddles and stared at him and he stared back at them.\r\nFinally he got up and moved forward a step or two and when he did that the\r\nthree swung from the saddles and moved forward, too, while the saddles hung there in the air, exactly as they'd left them.\r\n\n\n\n(From The Big Front Yard)\n\n",

They pulled up beside it, slapped down their helmets and went one by one through the airlock...\r\n\r\nThe airmaker was one of the most complicated machines in existence. A thing meant to transform the atmosphere of a planet had to be.\r\n\r\nThe intake scooped up the wind and drove it, with the help of wind-powered compressors, through a series of chambers; some of them held catalysts, some electric arcs or heating coils, maintaining temperature - the continuous storm ran a good-sized generator - and some led back into to others in a maze of interconnections. The actual chemistry was simple enough. Paraformaldehyde was broken down and yielded its binding water molecules; the formaldehyde , together with that taken directly from the air, reacted with ammonia and methane - or with itself - to produce a whole series of hydrocarbons, carbohydrates and more complex compounds for food, fuel and fertilizer.\r\n\r\nHuge as the unit loomed, it seemed pathetically small when you thought of the fantastic tonnage which was the total planetary atmosphere. But more of tis kind were being build every day and scattered around the surface of the world; over a million already existed, seven million was the goal, and that number should theoretically be able to do the job in another twenty Earth years.",

You remember, of course, that the Kaxorians had great reservoirs for storing light-energy in a bound state in their giant planes. They had bound light, light held by the gravitational attraction for itself, after condensing it in their apparatus, but they had what amounted to a gas\u0097gaseous light. Now suppose that someone makes a light condenser even more powerful than the one the Kaxorians used, a condenser that forces the light so close to itself, increases its density, till the photons hold each other permanently, and the substance becomes solid. It will be matter, matter made of light\u0097light matter\u0097and let us call it a metal.

In all there were thirteen of these moonlets, if I am so to call them; though no one section, of course, would reveal so many. Sustained on each side by their groined arches, the surface of the whole moon was built over them and under them,\u0097simply two domes connected at the bases. The chambers themselves were made lighter by leaving large, round windows or open circles in the parts of their vaults farthest from their points of contact, so that each of them looked not unlike the outer sphere of a Japanese ivory nest of concentric balls. You see the object was to make a moon, which, when left to its own gravity, should be fitly supported or braced within. Dear George was sure that, by this constant repetition of arches, we should with the least weight unite the greatest strength.

You all know\r\nthat a flywheel--heavy, very heavy on the circumference,\r\nlight, very light within it--was made to save up power,\r\nfrom the time when it was produced to the time when it\r\nwas wanted.  Yes?  Then, before we began even to\r\nbuild the moon, before we even began to make the brick,\r\nwe would build two gigantic fly-wheels, the diameter of\r\neach should be \"ever so great,\" the circumference heavy\r\nbeyond all precedent, and thundering strong, so that no\r\ntemptation might burst it.  They should revolve, their\r\nedges nearly touching, in opposite directions, for years,\r\nif it were necessary, to accumulate power, driven by some\r\nwaterfall now wasted to the world.  One should be a\r\nlittle heavier than the other.  When the Brick Moon was\r\nfinished, and all was ready, IT should be gently rolled\r\ndown a gigantic groove provided for it, till it lighted\r\non the edge of both wheels at the same instant.  Of\r\ncourse it would not rest there, not the ten-thousandth\r\npart of a second.  It would be snapped upward, as a drop\r\nof water from a grindstone.  Upward and upward; but the\r\nheavier wheel would have deflected it a little from the\r\nvertical.  Upward and northward it would rise, therefore,\r\ntill it had passed the axis of the world.  It would, of\r\ncourse, feel the world's attraction all the time, which\r\nwould bend its flight gently, but still it would leave\r\nthe world more and more behind.  Upward still, but now\r\nsouthward, till it had traversed more than one hundred\r\nand eighty degrees of a circle.  Little resistance,\r\nindeed, after it had cleared the forty or fifty miles of\r\nvisible atmosphere.  \"Now let it fall,\" said Q., inspired\r\nwith the vision.  \"Let it fall, and the sooner the\r\nbetter!

There is nothing special about the generator except that it is highly efficient and gives an almost constant electromotive force. The current thus produced is led across these points, which are composed of magnalloy, a development of the Bureau. We found on investigation that a spark gave out a light which was peculiarly rich in ultra-violet rays when it was passed between magnesium points. However, such points could not be used for the handling of a steady current because of lack of durability and ease of fusion, so a mixture of graphite, alundum and metallic magnesium was pressed together with a binder which will stand the heat. Thus we get the triple advantages of ultra-violet light production, durability, and high resistance.",

Commute discs rose in dense swarms and billowed away from the industrial zone toward the surrounding residential rings. Like nocturnal moths, the thick clouds of discs darkened the evening sky. Silent, weightless, they whisked their passengers toward home and waiting families, hot meals and bed.\r\n\r\nDon Walsh was the third man on his disc; he completed the load. As he dropped the coin in the slot the carpet rose impatiently. Walsh settled gratefully against the invisible safety-rail and unrolled the evening newspaper. Across from him the other two commuters were doing the same.\r\n\r\n\"This is where I get off,\" Walsh interrupted; he hurriedly yanked the stop-cord of the disc. It swept down toward the magnetic grapple at the end of his unit-section, a row of white squares set across the green and brown hillside.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute, friend.\" The red-haired man reached ominously for Walsh's sleeve, as the disc slid to a halt on the flat surface of the grapple. Surface cars were parked in rows; wives waiting to cart their husbands home. \"I don't like your attitude. You afraid to stand up and be counted? You ashamed to be a part of your race? By God, if you're not man enough to --\"",

For three hundred years, Eriston had been trying to construct logical paradoxes which the machine could not resolve. He did not expect to make serious progress before he had used up several lifetimes.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nThe Council ruled Diaspar, but the Council itself could be overridden by a superior power - the all-but-infinite intellect of the Central Computer. It was difficult not to think of the Central Computer as a living entity, localized in a single spot, though actually it was the sum total of all of the machines in Diaspar. Even if it was not alive in the biological sense, it certainly possessed at least as much awareness and self-consciousness as a human being.",

The resulting verdict, recorded automatically by opinion-sampling devices which no one had ever been able to suborn or deceive - and there had been enough attempts - decided the fate of the masterpiece.

                    "excerpt": "On the first landing of the square stairway of the mansion loomed a tall Dutch clock. The case was more than eight feet high, of a dark red wood, not mahogany, and it was curiously inlaid with silver. No common piece of furniture was this. About a hundred years ago there flourished in the town of Brunswick a horologist named Cary, an industrious and accomplished workman. Few well-to-do houses on that part of the coast lacked a Cary timepiece. But Aunt Gertrude's clock had marked the hours and minutes of two full centuries before the Brunswick artisan was born. It was running when William the Taciturn pierced the dikes to relieve Leyden. The name of the maker, Jan Lipperdam, and the date, 1572, were still legible in broad black letters and figures reaching quite across the dial. Cary's masterpieces were plebeian and recent beside this ancient aristocrat. The jolly Dutch moon, made to exhibit the phases over a landscape of windmills and polders, was cunningly painted. A skilled hand had carved the grim ornament at the top, a death's head transfixed by a two-edged sword. Like all timepieces of the sixteenth century, it had no pendulum. A simple Van Wyck escapement governed the descent of the weights to the bottom of the tall case.\r\n\r\nBut these weights never moved. Year after year, when Harry and I returned to Maine, we found the hands of the old clock pointing to the quarter past three, as they had pointed when we first saw them. The fat moon hung perpetually in the third quarter, as motionless as the death's head above. \r\n\r\nThere was a mystery about the silenced movement and the paralyzed hands. Aunt Gertrude told us that the works had never performed their functions since a bolt of lightning entered the clock; and she showed us a black hole in the side of the case near the top, with a yawning rift that extended downward for several feet. This explanation failed to satisfy us. It did not account for the sharpness of her refusal when we proposed to bring over the watchmaker from the village, or for her singular agitation once when she found Harry on a stepladder, with a borrowed key in his hand, about to test for himself the clock's suspended vitality.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne August night, after we had grown out of boyhood, I was awakened by a noise in the hallway. I shook my cousin. \"Somebody's in the house,\" I whispered.\r\n\r\nWe crept out of our room and on to the stairs. A dim light came from below. We held breath and noiselessly descended to the second landing. Harry clutched my arm. He pointed down over the banisters, at the same time drawing me back into the shadow.\r\n\r\nWe saw a strange thing.\r\n\r\nAunt Gertrude stood on a chair in front of the old clock, as spectral in her white nightgown and white nightcap as one of the poplars when covered with snow. It chanced that the floor creaked slightly under our feet. She turned with a sudden movement, peering intently into the darkness, and holding a candle high toward us, so that the light was full upon her pale face. She looked many years older than when I bade her good night. For a few minutes she was motionless, except in the trembling arm that held aloft the candle. Then, evidently reassured, she placed the light upon a shelf and turned again to the clock.\r\n\r\nWe now saw the old lady take a key from behind the face and proceed to wind up the weights. We could hear her breath, quick and short. She rested a band on either side of the case and held her face close to the dial, as if subjecting it to anxious scrutiny. In this attitude she remained for a long time. We heard her utter a sigh of relief, and she half turned toward us for a moment. I shall never forget the expression of wild joy that transfigured her features then.\r\n\r\nThe hands of the clock were moving; they were moving backward.\r\n",

He gaped at the figure \u0096 less strange now, although still puzzling \u0096 and noticed for the first time his snuff-coloured suit of rather odd pattern, his boots of curious leaden hue, his podgy face with a snub nose in the middle of it, his broad forehead surmounted by the funny fringe of the wig.

Inside that body had been arranged an electrical nerve-system, the controls of which led up into the square metal head. In that head, also, have been placed a small super-radio by which silent, constant communication could be had from metal body to metal body. Nerves, sense organs, muscle, they were all there, and all were artificial, in organic. The metal body lacked only a brain.\r\n\r\nIt was then that one of their scientists performed his greatest achievement, and brought success to their plan. From the living body of one of their number he removed the living brain, as their consummate art in Super-surgery enabled him to do. This living brain was then placed within a specially-prepared brain chamber of a metal body, inside its cubicle head. \r\n\n\n\r\nOf course you know that the human brain is fed from the bloodstream of the human body. To replace this, they placed the brain in a special solution, having all the properties of Nursing the brain cells. This solution is usually renewed once a week, so it is always fresh, and therefore the brain never really ages. \r\n\r\nWhen the brain is finally placed in its platinum chamber, the surgeon carefully connect the nerve ends of the brains with the electrical nerve connections of the metal body. Then an apparent miracle is accomplished. The body lives, it can move, and can walk. And that intelligence is now forever free from the demands of it's former body of flesh, residing as it does now in the untiring metal body which requires neither food nor sleep.",

The vibrations of gravitational force from the sun are thus different in wavelength from those of the earth, and it is the same always; the wavelength of no two emanations are the same. Thus the invaders could neutralize the sun's gravitational power on earth without affecting the power of the earth itself, or any other body. They would set up a wave-plant, or vibration machine, which would send out vibrations equal in wavelength to the sun's gravitational emanations; these would meet and oppose and neutralize the gravitational force of the sun. In that way, the sun with no longer pull earth, and the earth, therefore, would fly off into space on a tangent.",

The immortal Dalton himself\" (the word \"immortal\" was spoken with a sneer) \"might rise from his grave to witness it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Atoms--molecules! What are you talking about?\" I asked, bewildered.\r\n>{?\r\n\"You were looking on at the death of a molecule--a molecule of marsh gas, as I have already said. It was caused by a process which I would describe to you if I could reduce my own life work--and that of every scientific amateur who has preceded me since the world began--into half a dozen sentences. As that would be difficult, I must ask you to accept my personal assurance that you witnessed a fact, not a fiction of my imagination.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your instrument is so perfect that it not only renders molecules and atoms but their diffusion visible? It is a microscopic impossibility. At least it is amazing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw!\" Brande exclaimed impatiently. \"My instrument does certainly magnify to a marvellous extent, but not by the old device of the simple microscope, which merely focussed a large area of light rays into a small one. So crude a process could never show an atom to the human eye.\r\n\r\nI add much to that. I restore to the rays themselves the luminosity which they lost in their passage through our atmosphere. I give them back all their visual properties, and turn them with their full etheric blaze on the object under examination. Great as that achievement is, I deny that it is amazing. It may amaze a Papuan to see his eyelash magnified to the size of a wire, or an uneducated Englishman to see a cheesemite magnified to the size of a midge. It should not amaze you to see a simple process a little further developed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where does the danger you spoke of come in?\" I asked with a pretence of interest. Candidly, I did not believe a single word that Brande had said.\r\n\r\n\"If you will consult a common text-book on the physics of the ether,\" he replied, \"you will find that one grain of matter contains sufficient energy, if etherised, to raise a hundred thousand tons nearly two miles. In face of such potentiality it is not wise to wreck incautiously even the atoms of a molecule.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the limits to this description of scientific experiment? Where are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are no limits,\" Brande said decisively.\r\n\r\n\"No man can say to science 'thus far and no farther.' No man ever has been able to do so. No man ever shall!\"",

This crystal dome, illuminated with a dazzling light, which made the electric lamp look pale, was completely visible in all its parts, and appeared to belong to an immense conservator, covering the most strange and luxuriant vegetation. Further along, there seemed to be a continuation of the building, in the shape of galleries, likewise of crystal. All these galleries, like the dome, seemed to have a double transparent roof divided into compartments by water-tight partitions... Under the lower roof there was no water, but a clear and luminous atmosphere, where giant trees, handsome ferns, and many-colored flowers seem to live a luxuriant life. The floor of the submarine conservatory was covered with fine white sand, forming, as far as the eye could see, alleys crossing each other at right angles.",

Terens was mercifully unaware of this as the pilot room turned on its universal gimbals to meet the shifting gravity. Majestically, the ship's rear flanges fitted into the appropriate grooves of the pit. It stood upright, pointing to the sky.\r\n",

The geotects of Imperial Tectonics would not have known an ecosystem if they had been living in the middle of one.

Recollection of the night's events came abruptly to him, and he sprang to his feet in alarm, finding his muscles sore and stiff from his cramped position...\r\n\r\nThe sound came from a glistening metal machine which stood half-hidden in the brush a dozen yards away looking at him!\r\n\r\nThe thing was made of a lustrous, silvery metal, which Dan afterwards supposed to be aluminum, or some alloy of that metal. Its gleaming case was shaped more like a coffin, or an Egyptian mummy-case, than any other object with which he was familiar, though rather larger than either.\r\n\r\nThat is, it was an oblong metal box, tapering toward the ends, with the greatest width forward of the middle. Twin tubes projected from the end of it, lenses in them glistening like eyes. Just below them sprang out steely, glistening tentacles several feet long, writhing and twitching as if they were alive. The tangle of green brush hid the thing's legs, so that Dan could not see them.\r\n\r\nSuddenly it sprang toward him, rising ten feet high and covering half the distance between them. It alighted easily upon the two long, jointed metal limbs upon which it had leapt, and continued to keep the lens-tubes turned toward Dan, so he knew that the grotesque metal thing was watching him.\r\n\r\nThe limbs, he observed, were similar to the hind legs of a grasshopper, both in shape and position. And evidently the thing leapt upon them in about the same way...\r\n\r\nFor several minutes the two stood there, studying each other. A naked man, tense and bewildered in the presence of mysterious forces\u0097and a grotesque machine, cased in gleaming white metal, whose parts seemed to duplicate most of the functions of a living creature.\r\n\r\nThen one of the writhing tentacles that shot from the \"head\" of the machine reached back under the metal case, and reappeared grasping what appeared to be a flat disk of emerald, two inches across and half an inch thick.\r\n\r\nThis green disk it held up, with a flat side toward Dan. There was no sound, but a flash of green light came from it, cutting a wide swath into the jungle, and littering its path with smoking and flaming debris.\r\n\r\nBut Dan, expecting something of the kind, had flung himself sidewise into the shelter of the boulder beside which he had slept. Behind it, he gathered his feet under him, picked up a rock of convenient size for throwing, and waited, ready and alert.\r\n\r\nHe heard the soft humming sound on the other side of the boulder. A[11] glittering object flashed above him. Crashing through the brush the metal monster came to earth on the same side of the boulder with him.\r\n\r\nBut the metal thing had not turned in its flight: consequently its rear end was toward Dan. As it began cumberously to turn about, he hurled his rock with an accuracy that came of a boyhood on the farm. Instinct had made him try for the little ring and needle on the back of the monster, apparently its most vulnerable part.",

And there never was a floor that didn't need cleaning. It swept, or mopped, or vacuum-cleaned, or polished, consulting tapes in its idiot memory to decide which. Anything larger than a BB shot it picked up and placed in a tray on its upper surface, for someone brighter to decide whether to keep or throw away. It went quietly looking for dirt all day long, in search curves that could miss nothing, passing over clean floors in its endless search for dirty floors. It would get out of a room with people in it, like a well-trained maid, unless its mistress caught up with it and flipped a switch to tell the poor thing it was welcome. Around dinnertime it would go to its stall and soak up a quick charge-this was before we installed the everlasting power pack. There was not too much difference between Hired Girl, Mark One, and a vacuum cleaner. But the difference-that it would clean without supervision-was enough; it sold.\"",

The intercontinental missiles we had struck back with \"thought\" with Thorsen tubes, and traffic-control systems in places like Los Angeles used an idiot form of them. No need to go into theory of an electronic tube that even Bell Labs doesn't understand too well, the point is that you can hook a Thorsen tube into a control circuit, direct the machine through an operation by manual control, and the tube will \"remember\" what was done and can direct the operation without a human supervisor a second time, or any number of times. \r\n\r\nFor an automated machine tool this is enough; for guided missiles and for Flexible Frank you add side circuits that give the machine \"judgment.\" Actually it isn't judgment (in my opinion a machine can never have judgment); the side circuit is a hunting circuit, the programming of which says \"look for so-and-so within such-and-such limits; when you find it, carry out your basic instruction.\" The basic instruction can be as complicated as you can crowd into one Thorsen memory tube-which is a very wide limit indeed!-and you can program so that your \"judgment\" circuits (moronic back-seat drivers, they are) can interrupt the basic instructions any time the cycle does not match that originally impressed into the Thorsen tube. This meant that you need cause Flexible Frank to clear the table and scrape the dishes and load them into the dishwasher only once, and from then on he could cope with any dirty dishes he ever encountered. \r\n\r\nBetter still, he could have an electronically duplicated Thorsen tube stuck into his head and could handle dirty dishes the first time he ever encountered them . . - and never break a dish. Stick another \"memorized\" tube alongside the first one and he could change a wet baby first time, and never, never, never stick a pin in the baby. Frank's square head could easily hold a hundred Thorsen tubes, each with an electronic \"memory\" of a different household task. Then throw a guard circuit around all the \"judgment\" circuits, a circuit which required him to hold still and squawl for help if he ran into something not covered by his instructions-that way you wouldn't use up babies or dishes.",

No care had been taken to provide a particular area for any sentient species. If there was any plan to the park it was a maintenance plan with plants requiring similar conditions and care held in their own sectors. Giant Spear Pines from Sasak occupied a knoll near one corner surrounded by mounds of Flame Briar from Rudiria. There were bold stretches of lawn and hidden scraps of lawn, and some flat stretches of greenery which were not lawns at all but mobile sheets of predatory leaf imprisoned behind thin moats of caustic water.\r\n\r\nRain-jeweled flowers often held McKie's attention to the exclusion of all else. There was a single planting of Lilium Grossa, its red blossoms twice his height casting long shadows over a wriggling carpet of blue Syringa, each miniature bloom opening and closing at random like tiny mouths gasping for air.\r\n\r\nSometimes, floral perfumes stopped his progress and held him in a momentary olfactory thralldom while his eyes searched out the source. As often as not, the plant would be a dangerous one - a flesh eater or poison-sweat variety. Warning signs in flashing Galach guarded such plantings. Sonabarriers, moats, and force fields edged the winding paths in many areas.\r\n\r\nMcKie had a favorite spot in the park, a bench with its back to a fountain where he could sit and watch the shadows collect across fat yellow bushes from the floating islands of Tandaloor. The yellow bushes thrived because their roots were washed in running water hidden beneath the soil and renewed by the fountain. Beneath the yellow bushes there were faint gleams of phosphorescent silver enclosed by a force field and identified by a low sign:\r\n\r\n\"Sangeet Mobilus, a blood-sucking perennial from Bisaj. Extreme danger to all sentient species. Do not intrude any portion of your body beyond the force field.\"\r\n\r\nAs he sat on the bench, McKie thought about that sign. The universe often mixed the beautiful and the dangerous. This was a deliberate mixture in the park. The yellow bushes, the fragrant and benign Golden Iridens, had been mingled with Sangeet Mobilus. The two supported each other and both thrived. The ConSentient government which McKie served often made such mixtures... sometimes by accident.",

Technically, dirt-farming was a complicated government conducted science which investigated the hit-or-miss natural processes that paralleled mankind's defter manipulations of botanical growth. But Priderell, it appeared, was using the term in its archaic sense. Rhysgaat had the average large proportion of unpopulated and rarely visited areas; and in one of them, she said, was her hideaway\u0097a small, primitive farm, where she grew things in real dirt, all by herself.\r\n\"What kind of things?\" asked Grevan, trying not to sound too incredulous.\r\n\"Butter-squogs are much the best,\" she replied, rather cryptically. \"But there're all kinds! You've no idea . . .\"\r\nShe was not, of course, implying that she ate them, though for a moment it had sounded like that to Grevan. After getting its metabolism progressively disarmed for some fifty centuries by the benefits of nutriculture, ordinary-human knew better than to sample the natural growths of even its own worlds. If suicide seemed called for, there were gentler methods of doing it.\r\nHowever, it would hardly be polite, he decided uneasily, to inquire further.",

They had developed a practical psychology of their own to free themselves of those thought-traps, but they had no way of knowing how successful they had been. If any such hypnotic mechanisms remained undiscovered in them, the penalty for defying Central Government's instructions would be automatic and disastrous.\r\nGrevan could see himself again as a frightened, rebellious boy inside a subterranean conditioning vault, facing the apparently blank wall which concealed one of the machines known as Dominators. He heard the flat, toneless voice of the legendary monster, almost as old as Central Government itself, watched the dazzling hypnotic patterns slide and shift suddenly across the wall, and felt hard knots of compulsive thought leap up in response and fade almost instantly beyond the reach of his consciousness.\r\nThat had been his first experience with CG's euphemistically termed \"restraints.\" The Dominator had installed three of them and let the boy know what to expect if rebellion was attempted again. Two days later, he had skeptically put the power of the restraints to a test, and had very nearly died then and there.\r\n",

On the third leaf, she uttered a wild whoop, doubled up, and began to adapt at speed. That took about twelve seconds, but they allowed a full ten minutes then to let the reaction flush her blood stream. Then Vernet was sampled in turn and staggered back to the beach with a martyred expression, while Klim and Muscles started cabbage-hunting.\r\nGrevan retired to the ship's laboratory, where he poured the half cupful of blood he had extracted from the martyr's veins carefully into a small retort. Ontogenetic adaptation, with reaction-times that crowded zero, to anything new in the way of infections or absorbed venoms was one of the more useful talents of their specialized strain. Considerable unauthorized research and experimentation finally had revealed to them just how they did it. The invading substance was met by an instantaneous regrouping of complex enzyme chains in every body cell affected by it, which matched and nullified its specific harmful properties and left the Group member involved permanently immune to them.\r\nThe experience of getting immunized sometimes included the momentary impression of having swallowed a small but active volcano, but that illusion didn't last long enough to be taken very seriously by anyone but the sufferer. Vernet's blood emerged from processing presently in the shape of small pink pills; and just before dinner everybody washed down two each of these and thus adapted the easy way, while the donor denounced them as vampires.\r\n",

For a moment, it hung spinning quietly in the air above the ramp, with Klim perched on top. Then Muscles came out through the lock and attached himself to the gadget's side. They floated down lopsidedly together, accompanied by tinkling sounds from the cooker's interior.\r\n\"What's it going to be tonight?\" Grevan asked, reaching up to guide them in to an even landing.\r\n\"Albert II in mushroom sauce,\" said Klim. She was a tall, slender blonde with huge blue eyes and a deceptively wistful expression. As he grounded the cooker, she put a hand on his shoulder and stepped down. \"Not a very original menu, I'll admit! But there's a nice dessert anyway. How about sampling some local vegetables to go with Albert?\"\r\n..... \r\n\r\n\"Klim thinks Albert is beginning to look puny again,\" Cusat announced. \"Probably nothing much to it, but how about coming along and helping us diagnose?\"\r\nThe Group's three top biologists adjourned to the ship, with Muscles, whose preferred field was almost-pure mathematics, trailing along just for company. They found Albert II quiescent in vitro\u0097as close a thing to a self-restoring six-foot sirloin steak as ever had been developed.\r\n\"He's quit assimilating, and he's even a shade off-color,\" Klim pointed out, a little anxiously.\r\nThey debated his requirements at some length. As a menu staple, Albert was hard to beat, but unfortunately he was rather dainty in his demands. Chemical balances, temperatures, radiations, flows of stimulant, and nutritive currents\u0097all had to be just so; and his notions of what was just so were subject to change without notice. If they weren't catered to regardless, he languished and within the week perversely died. At least, the particular section of him that was here would die. As an institution, of course, he might go on growing and nourishing his Central Government clients immortally.\r\nMuscles might have been of help in working out the delicate calculations involved in solving Albert's current problems, but when they looked round for him, they found him blinking at a steady flow of invisible symbols over one wall of the tank room, while his lips moved in a rapid, low muttering; and they knew better than to interrupt. He had gone off on impromptu calculations of his own, from which he would emerge eventually with some useful bit of information or other, though ten to one it would have nothing to do with Albert. Meanwhile, he would be grouchy and useless if roused to direct his attention to anything below the level of an emergency.\r\nThey reset the currents finally and, at Cusat's suggestion, trimmed Albert around the edges. Finding himself growing lighter, he suddenly began to absorb nourishment again at a very satisfactory rate.\r\n\"That did it, I guess,\" Cusat said, pleased. He glanced at the small pile of filets they'd sliced off. \"Might as well have a barbecue now.\"\r\n",

Get away!\" I cried.\r\n\r\nLarry shouted, as we all stood bathed in the dull light from the Robot:\r\n\r\n\"Look out! It sees us!\"\r\n\r\nHe fired again, into the light\u0097and murmured, \"Why\u0097why\u0097\"\r\n\r\nA great surprise and terror was in his tone. Beside me, with half-leveled revolver, Alten stood transfixed. And he too was muttering something.\r\n\r\nAll this happened in an instant. And there I was aware that I was trying to get my rifle up for firing again; but I could not. My arms stiffened. I tried to take a step, tried to move a foot, but could not. I was rooted there; held, as though by some giant magnet, to the ground!\r\n\r\nThis horrible dull-red light! It was cold\u0097a frigid, paralyzing blast. The blood ran like cold water in my veins. My feet were heavy with the weight of my body pressing them down.\r\n\r\nThen the Robot was moving; coming forward; holding the light upon us. I thought I heard its voice\u0097and a horrible, hollow, rasping laugh.\r\n\r\nMy brain was chilling. I had confused thoughts; impressions, vague and dreamlike. As though in a dream I felt myself standing there with Mary[38] clinging to me. Both of us were frozen inert upon our feet.\r\n\r\nI tried to shout, but my tongue was too thick; my throat seemed swelling inside. I heard Alten's revolver clatter to the stone pavement of the yard. And saw him fall forward\u0097out.",

Almost all the work of the world, particularly in America, and most particularly in the mechanical center of New York City, was done by machinery. And the machinery itself was guided, handled, operated\u0097even, in some instances, constructed\u0097by other, more intricate machines. They were fashioned in pseudo-human form\u0097thinking, logically acting, independently acting mechanisms: the Robots. All but human, they were\u0097a new race. Inferior to humans, yet similar.\r\n\r\nAnd in 2930 the machines, slaves of idle human masters, had been developed too highly! They were upon the verge of a revolt!\r\n\r\nAll this Tina briefly sketched now to Larry. And to Larry it seemed a very distant, very academic danger. Yet so soon all of us were plunged into the midst of it!\r\n\r\nThe revolt had not yet come, but it was feared. A great Robot named Migul seemed fomenting it. The revolt was smouldering; at any moment it would burst; and then the machines would rise to destroy the humans",

The fingers were stiffly outstretched\r\nand barely skimmed the floor surface of the tunnel. As we passed\r\nthrough a spot of light I saw that Migul had extended from each of\r\nthe fingertips an inch-long filament of wire, like finger nails.\r\n\r\nThe Robot murmured abruptly, \"Tugh's vibrations are here. I can feel\r\nthem. He has passed this way recently.\"\r\n\r\nTugh's trail! I knew then that Tugh's body, touching this ground, had\r\naltered to some infinitesimal degree the floor-substance's inherent\r\nvibration characteristics. Vibrations of every sort are communicable\r\nfrom one substance to another. Tugh's trail was here--his\r\nvibration-scent--and like a hound with his nose to the ground, Migul's\r\nfingers with the extended filaments were feeling it. What strange\r\nsensitivity! What an amazing development of science was manifested in\r\nevery move and act and word of this Robot! Yet, in my own Time-world\r\nof 1935, it was all crudely presaged: this now before me was merely\r\nthe culmination.\r\n\r\n\"He recently passed,\" said Migul. We stopped, I close beside the\r\nstooping metal figure. The Robot's voice was a furtive sepulchral\r\nwhisper that filled me with awe.\r\n\r\n\"How long ago?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"He passed here an hour or two ago, perhaps. The vibrations are fading\r\nout. But it was Tugh. Well do I know him. Put your hand down. Feel the\r\nvibrations?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot. My fingers are not that sensitive, Migul.\"\r\n\r\nA faint contempt was in the Robot's tone. \"I forgot that you are a\r\nman.\" Then it straightened, and the extended filaments slid back into\r\nits fingers. It said softly, \"There is one guard in this passage.\"",

Harl had it leveled and was gazing through it.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] The workings of the Time-telespectroscope involve all the intricate postulates and mathematical formulae of Time-traveling itself. As a matter of practicality, however, the results obtained are simple of understanding. The etheric vibratory rate of the vehicles while traveling through Time was constantly changing. Through the telespectroscope one cage was visible to the other across the five hundred feet of intervening Space when they approached a simultaneous Time; when they, so to speak, were tuned in unison.\r\n\r\nThus, Harl explained, the other cage would show as a ghost, the faintest of wraiths, over a Time-distance of some five or ten years. And the closer in Time they approached it, the more solid it would appear.",

He had fused together a number of metals and certain other things - I wish I knew the particulars now ! - and he intended to leave the mixture a week and then allow it to cool slowly. Unless he had miscalculated, the last stage in the combination would occur when the stuff sank to a temperature of 60 Fahr. But it chanced that, unknown to Cavor, dissension had arisen about the furnace tending. Gibbs, who had previously seen to this, had suddenly attempted to shift it to the man who had been a gardener, on the score that coal was soil, being dug, and therefore could not possibly fall within the province of a joiner; the man who had been a jobbing gardener alleged, however, that coal was a metallic or ore-like substance, let alone that he was cook. But Spargus insisted on Gibbs doing the coaling, seeing that he was a joiner and that coal is notoriously fossil wood. Consequently Gibbs ceased to replenish the furnace, and no one else did so, and Cavor was too much immersed in certain interesting problems concerning a Cavorite flying machine (neglecting the resistance of the air and one or two other points) to perceive that anything was wrong. And the premature birth of his invention took place just as he was coming across the field to my bungalow for our afternoon talk and tea.\r\n\r\n...\"You are quite clear that the stuff is opaque to gravitation, that it cuts off things from gravitating towards each other? \"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said I. \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, so soon as it reached a temperature of 60 Fahr, and the process of its manufacture was complete, the air above it, the portions of roof and ceiling and floor above it ceased to have weight. I suppose you know - everybody knows nowadays - that, as a usual thing, the air has weight, that it presses on everything at the surface of the earth, presses in all directions, with a pressure of fourteen and a half pounds to the square inch? \"\r\n\r\n\"I know that,\" said I. \" Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that too,\" he remarked. \" Only this shows you how useless knowledge is unless you apply it. You see, over our Cavorite this ceased to be the case, the air there ceased to exert any pressure, and the air round it and not over the Cavorite was exerting a pressure of fourteen pounds and a half to the square in upon this suddenly weightless air. Ah! you begin to see! The air all about the Cavorite crushed in upon the air above it with irresistible force. The air above the Cavorite was forced upward violently, the air that rushed in to replace it immediately lost weight, ceased to exert any pressure, followed suit, blew the ceiling through and the roof off.",

No way to see, of course, but I could imagine the pale blue solution - ethylene glycol and something else - foaming up around and over us. The suit material, cool and dry, collapsed in to touch my skin at every point. I knew that my internal body pressure was increasing rapidly to match the increasing fluid pressure outside. That's what the shot was for... By the time my meter said '2' (external pressure equivalent to a column of water two nautical miles deep), I felt that I was at the same time being crushed and bloated...\r\n\r\nThe major drawback to the system is that, of course, anybody caught outside of his shell when the Anniversary hit 25 gees would be just so much strawberry jam...",

If they could be mass-produced, Artsutanov's dream could become reality, and the economics of space transportation would be utterly transformed.\r\n   \"Before the end of the twentieth century, super-strength materials \u0096 hyperfilaments \u0096 had begun to emerge from the laboratory. But they were extremely expensive, costing many times their weight in gold. Millions of tons would be needed to build a system that could carry all Earth's outbound traffic; so the dream remained a dream.\r\n   \u0093Until a few months ago. Now the deep-space factories can manufacture virtually unlimited quantities of hyperfilament. At last we can build the Space Elevator or the Orbital Tower, as I prefer to call it. For in a sense it is a tower, rising clear through the atmosphere, and far, far beyond\u0085\u0094",

Electromechanically.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how?\"\r\n\r\n\"...Well, then, my mother, as a cerebral surgeon, knew the anatomy of the human brain. My father, as an instrument maker, designed and built encephalographs. Together, they discovered that if the great waves of the human brain were filtered down and the extremely minute waves that rode on top of them were amplified, the pattern of these superfine waves went through convolutions peculiar to certain thoughts...\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, the general theory is that the cells of the brain act sort of like a binary digital computer, with certain banks of cells operating to store sufficient bits of information to furnish a complete memory. In the process of memorization, individual cells become activated and linked by the constant repetition.\r\n\r\n\"Second, the brain within the skull is a prisoner, connected to the 'outside' by the five standard sensory channels of sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. Stimulate a channel, and the result is a certain wave-shape of electrical impulse that enters the brain and\u0097sort of like the key to a Yale lock\u0097fits only one combination of cells. Or if no previous memory is there, it starts its own new collection of cells to linking and combining. When we repeat and repeat, we are deepening the groove, so to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Finally comes the Holden Machine. The helmet makes contact with the skull in those spots where the probes of the encephalograph are placed. When the brain is stimulated into thought, the brain waves are monitored and recorded, amplified, and then fed back to the same brain-spots. Not once, but multifold, like the vibration of a reed or violin string. The circuit that accepts signals, amplifies them, returns them to the same set of terminals, and causes them to be repeated several hundred times per millisecond without actually ringing or oscillating is the real research secret of the machine. My father's secret and now mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how do we use it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You want to memorize a list of ingredients,\" said James. \"So you will put this helmet on your head with the cookbook in your hands. You will turn on the machine when you have read the part you want to memorize just to be sure of your material. Then, with the machine running, you carefully read aloud the passage from your book. The vibrating amplifier in the machine monitors and records each electrical impulse, then furnishes it back to your brain as a successive series of repetitious vibrations, each identical in shape and magnitude, just as if you had actually read and re-read that list of stuff time and again.\"",

                    "excerpt": "They go into a dim room containing a huge cabinet like a one-man sauna and a console for Joe. The room has a glass wall that\u0092s all dark now. And just for your information, the whole shebang is five hundred feet underground near what used to be Carbondale, Pa.\r\nJoe opens the sauna-cabinet like a big clamshell standing on end with a lot of funny business inside. Our girl shucks her shi\ueecb and walks into it bare, totally unembarrassed. Eager. She settles in face-forward, butting jacks into sockets. Joe closes it carefully onto her humpback. Clunk. She can\u0092t see in there or hear or move. She hates this minute. But how she loves what comes next!\r\nJoe\u0092s at his console and the lights on the other side of the glass wall come up. A room is on the other side, all fluff and kicky bits, a girly bedroom. In the bed is a small mound of silk with a rope of yellow hair hanging out.\r\nThe sheets stirs and gets whammed back flat.\r\nSitting up in the bed is the darlingest girl child you\u0092ve EVER seen. She quiv- ers\u0097porno for angels. She sticks both her little arms straight up, flips her hair, looks around full of sleepy pazazz. Then she can\u0092t resist rubbing her hands down over her minibreasts and belly. Because, you see, it\u0092s the godawful P. Burke who is sitting there hugging her perfect girl-body, looking at you out of delighted eyes.\r\nThen the kitten hops out of bed and crashes flat on the floor.\r\nFrom the sauna in the dim room comes a strangled noise. P. Burke, trying to rub her wired-up elbow is suddenly smothered in two bodies, electrodes jerking in her flesh. Joe juggles inputs, crooning into his mike. The flurry passes; it\u0092s all right.\r\nIn the lighted room the elf gets up, casts a cute glare at the glass wall and goes into a transparent cubicle. A bathroom, what else? She\u0092s a live girl, and live girls have to go to the bathroom after a night\u0092s sleep even if their brains are in a sauna-cabinet in the next room. And P. Burke isn\u0092t in that cabinet, she\u0092s in the bathroom. Perfectly simple, if you have the glue for that closed training circuit that\u0092s letting her run her neural system by remote control.\r\nNow let\u0092s get one thing clear. P. Burke does not feel her brain is in the sauna room, she feels she\u0092s in that sweet little body. When you wash your hands, do you feel the water is running on your brain? Of course not. You feel the water on your hand, although the \u0093feeling\u0094 is actually a potential-pattern flickering over the electrochemical jelly between your ears. And it\u0092s delivered there via the long circuits \ueecaom your hands. Just so, P. Burke\u0092s brain in the cabinet feels the water on her hands in the bathroom. The fact that the signals have jumped across space on the way in makes no difference at all. If you want the jargon, it\u0092s known as eccentric projection or sensory reference and you\u0092ve done it all your life. Clear?",

At first I was struck by the large size of these bees. Although they were not as big as those which Gulliver met in Brobdingnag - he defended himself against them with his little sword - they were considerably larger than a normal bee or even a hornet. They were about the size of a walnut still encased in its green shell. The wings were not movable like the wings of birds or insects, but were arranged around their bodies in a rigid band and acted as stabilizing and supporting surfaces.\r\n\r\nTheir large size was less striking than one might think, since they were completely transparent. Indeed, my idea of them was derived mainly from the glitter of their movements as seen in the sunlight. When the creature I now watched hovered before the blossom of a convolvulus whose calyx it tapped with a tong shaped like a glass probe, it was almost invisible.",

Around the edge of the pool was a level platform, and then the walls of the cave rose perpendicularly for a few feet to arch toward the centre of the low roof. The walls about the ledge were pierced with a number of entrances to dimly lighted passageways. Toward one of these our captors led us, and after a short walk halted before a steel cage which lay at the bottom of a shaft rising above us as far as one could see. The cage proved to be one of the common types of elevator cars that I had seen in other parts of Barsoom. They are operated by means of enormous magnets which are suspended at the top of the shaft. By an electrical device the volume of magnetism generated is regulated and the speed of the car varied. In long stretches they move at a sickening speed, especially on the upward trip, since the small force of gravity inherent to Mars results in very little opposition to the powerful force above. Scarcely had the door of the car closed behind us than we were slowing up to stop at the landing above, so rapid was our ascent of the long shaft. When we emerged from the little building which houses the upper terminus of the elevator, we found ourselves in the midst of a veritable fairyland of beauty. The combined languages of Earth men hold no words to convey to the mind the gorgeous beauties of the scene.",

                    "excerpt": "This was an enormous projectile, the peculiarity of which was that its motive power was contained within itself, very much as a rocket contains the explosives which send it upward. It differed, however, from the rocket or any other similar projectile, and many of its features were entirely original with Roland Clewe.\r\nThis extraordinary piece of mechanism, which was called the automatic shell, was of cylindrical form, eighteen feet in length and four feet in diameter. The forward end was conical and not solid, being formed of a number of flat steel rings, decreasing in size as they approached the point of the cone. When not in operation these rings did not touch one another, but they could be forced together by pressure on the point of the cone. This shell might contain explosives or not, as might be considered desirable, and it was not intended to fire it from a cannon, but to start it on its course from a long semi-cylindrical trough, which would be used simply to give it the desired direction. After it had been started by a ram worked by an engine at the rear end of the trough, it immediately bean to propel itself by means of the mechanism contained within it.\r\n\n\n\n(The automatic shell)\n\n\r\nBut the great value of this shell lay in the fact that the moment it encountered a solid substance or obstruction of any kind its propelling power became increased. The rings which formed the cone on its forward end were pressed together, the electric motive power was increased in proportion to the pressure, and thus the greater the resistance to this projectile the greater became its velocity and power of progression, and its onward course continued until its self-containing force had been exhausted...\r\n\r\nIn less than a day Clewe had perfected an idea which he believed might be of practical service. For some time there had been talk of a new railroad in this part of the State, but one of the difficulties in the way was the necessity of making a tunnel or a deep cut through a small mountain. To go round this mountain would be objectionable for many reasons, and to go through it would be enormously expensive. Clewe knew the country well, and his soul glowed within him as he thought that here perhaps was an opportunity for him to demonstrate the value of his invention, not only as an agent in warfare, but as a wonderful assistant in the peaceful progress of the world.\r\nThere was no reason why such shells should not be constructed for the express purpose of making tunnels. Nothing could be better adapted for an experiment of this kind than the low mountain in question. If the shell passed through it at the desired point, there would be nothing beyond which could be injured, and it would then enter the end of a small chain of mountains, and might pass onward, as far as its motive power would carry it, without doing any damage whatever. Moreover, its course could be followed and it could be recovered.",

When one of these magnetic shells was thrown anywhere in the vicinity of an iron ship, the powerful magnetism developed within it instantly attracted it to the vessel, which was destroyed by the ensuing contact and explosion. Two ironclads meeting on the ocean need each to fire but one shell to be both destroyed. The inability of iron battle-ships to withstand this improvement in artillery had already set the naval architects of the world upon the work of constructing warships which would not attract the magnetic shell\u0097which was effective even when laid on the bottoms of harbors\u0097and Roland Clewe had been engaged in making plans and experiments for the construction of a paper man-of-war, which he believed would meet the requirements of the situation.",

                    "link": "content.asp?Bnum=2853",
                    "excerpt": "The Artesian ray, of which these two spoke, was an invention upon which Roland Clewe had been experimenting for a long time, and which was and had been the object of his labors and studies while in Europe. In the first decade of the century it had been generally supposed that the X ray, or cathode ray, had been developed and applied to the utmost extent of its capability. It was used in surgery and in mechanical arts, and in many varieties of scientific operations, but no considerable advance in its line of application had been recognized for a quarter of a century. But Roland Clewe had come to believe in the existence of a photic force, somewhat similar to the cathode ray, but of infinitely greater significance and importance to the searcher after physical truth. Simply described, his discovery was a powerful ray produced by a new combination of electric lights, which would penetrate down into the earth, passing through all substances which it met in its way, and illuminating and disclosing everything through which it passed.\r\nAll matter likely to be found beneath the surface of the earth in that part of the country had been experimented upon by Clewe, and nothing had resisted the penetrating and illuminating influence of his ray\u0097well called Artesian ray, for it was intended to bore into the bowels of the earth. After making many minor trials of the force and powers of his light, Roland Clewe had undertaken the construction of a massive apparatus, by which he believed a ray could be generated which, little by little, perhaps foot by foot, would penetrate into the earth and light up everything between the farthest point it had attained and the lenses of his machine. That is to say, he hoped to produce a long hole of light about three feet in diameter and as deep as it was possible to make it descend, in which he could see all the various strata and deposits of which the earth is composed. How far he could send down this piercing cylinder of light he did not allow himself to consider. With a small and imperfect machine he had seen several feet into the ground; with a great and powerful apparatus, such as he was now constructing, why should he not look down below the deepest point to which man's knowledge had ever reached? Down so far that he must follow his descending light with a telescope; down, down until he had discovered the hidden secrets of the earth!\r\nThe peculiar quality of this light, which gave it its great preeminence over all other penetrating rays, was the power it possessed of illuminating an object; passing through it; rendering it transparent and invisible; illuminating the opaque substance it next met in its path, and afterwards rendering that transparent. If the rocks and earth in the cylindrical cavities of light which Clewe had already produced in his experiments had actually been removed with pickaxes and shovels, the lighted hole a few feet in depth could not have appeared more real, the bottom and sides of the little well could not have been revealed more sharply and distinctly; and yet there was no hole in the ground, and if one should try to put his foot into the lighted perforation he would find it as solid as any other part of the earth.",

It saved a lot of muscular expenditure, of course, but meant that you had to sit infuriatingly still if you wanted to keep listening to the same program.\r\n\r\nZaphod waved a hand and the channel switched again.",

Inside the globe, red-faced, furious, and hammering on the transparent surface with a calloused fist, was Sector Chief of Scouts Gregory MacIntyre. \r\n\r\nHe settled down comfortably in the control room and flipped through the instruction manual for the Model M1-X IntruGrab (medium). Connely hoped to find the instructions for his helmet\u0097but they weren't there. Scowling, he went back to the beginning of the manual, and carefully worked his way past diagrams and descriptions, noting a sentence here and a technical detail there, which gave him enough to go on so that he saw the purpose and general mode of operation of the device even before he read the final paragraph at the back of the manual: \r\n\r\n\"In brief, the M1-X IntruGrab (medium) is designed to prevent human or other intruders from gaining entrance to restricted localities. Once keyed to the physical characteristics of the personnel legitimately present, and activated to prevent entry of others, the IntruGrab will selectively remove unauthorized intruders, will imprison such intruders for an indefinite period, removing waste products and providing minimal nutritive requirements according to the specifications table on page 32. The IntruGrab (medium) will handle individuals from the size of a grasshopper to that of an adult male gorilla, and will signal capture by flashing light, tone alarm, or other standard warning mechanism. \r\n\r\nCAUTION: The manufacturers do not warrant use of the M1-X IntruGrab (medium) for any purpose contrary to local statute or ordinance. Consult your lawyer or local lawenforcement agencies before installing.\" \r\n\r\nConnely skimmed back through the manual to the instructions for releasing captured intruders. He discovered that there were two methods of release: permanent, and provisional. He decided he should not overburden his mind by studying too much at once, so he only learned how to release an intruder provisionally. \r\n\r\nArmed with this information, he went back down the corridor, and looked up. MacIntyre was glaring down through the bars with a look that would have shriveled the self-confidence of almost any subordinate. Connely, however, had not gravitated into the Stellar Scouts by accident. and so as he looked back at MacIntyre, a grin gradually spread over his face. This brought MacIntyre to a state of boiling rage bordering on apoplexy. Connely, alarmed lest MacIntyre hurt himself, mentally reviewed the instructions, then raised his hand toward the globe. An orange light blinked on. \r\n\r\n\"Lower,\" said Connely. \r\n\r\nThe globe came down on a frame like a set of lazy tongs. A number of plastic tubes snapped loose from the globe and coiled up into the ceiling. \"Release,\" said Connely. The transparent layer slid back, the bars came open, and MacIntyre stumbled out.",

There is building up as well as breaking down and changing.\r\nYou have heard, perhaps, of a common surgical operation resorted to in\r\ncases where the nose has been destroyed:  a flap of skin is cut from\r\nthe forehead, turned down on the nose, and heals in the new position.\r\nThis is a kind of grafting in a new position of part of an animal\r\nupon itself.  Grafting of freshly obtained material from another\r\nanimal is also possible,--the case of teeth, for example.\r\nThe grafting of skin and bone is done to facilitate healing:\r\nthe surgeon places in the middle of the wound pieces of skin snipped\r\nfrom another animal, or fragments of bone from a victim freshly killed.\r\nHunter's cock-spur--possibly you have heard of that--flourished on\r\nthe bull's neck; and the rhinoceros rats of the Algerian zouaves are\r\nalso to be thought of,--monsters manufactured by transferring a slip\r\nfrom the tail of an ordinary rat to its snout, and allowing it to heal in\r\nthat position.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsters manufactured!\" said I. \"Then you mean to tell me--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  These creatures you have seen are animals carven and wrought\r\ninto new shapes.  To that, to the study of the plasticity of\r\nliving forms, my life has been devoted.  I have studied for years,\r\ngaining in knowledge as I go.  I see you look horrified, and yet I\r\nam telling you nothing new.  It all lay in the surface of practical\r\nanatomy years ago, but no one had the temerity to touch it.\r\nIt is not simply the outward form of an animal which I can change.\r\nThe physiology, the chemical rhythm of the creature, may also be made\r\nto undergo an enduring modification,--of which vaccination and other\r\nmethods of inoculation with living or dead matter are examples\r\nthat will, no doubt, be familiar to you.  A similar operation is\r\nthe transfusion of blood,--with which subject, indeed, I began.\r\nThese are all familiar cases.  Less so, and probably far more extensive,\r\nwere the operations of those mediaeval practitioners who made\r\ndwarfs and beggar-cripples, show-monsters,--some vestiges of whose\r\nart still remain in the preliminary manipulation of the young\r\nmountebank or contortionist.  Victor Hugo gives an account of them\r\nin 'L'Homme qui Rit.'--But perhaps my meaning grows plain now.\r\nYou begin to see that it is a possible thing to transplant tissue\r\nfrom one part of an animal to another, or from one animal to another;\r\nto alter its chemical reactions and methods of growth; to modify\r\nthe articulations of its limbs; and, indeed, to change it in its most\r\nintimate structure.\n\r\n\"And yet this extraordinary branch of knowledge has never been sought\r\nas an end, and systematically, by modern investigators until I took it up!\r\nSome such things have been hit upon in the last resort of surgery;\r\nmost of the kindred evidence that will recur to your mind has been\r\ndemonstrated as it were by accident,--by tyrants, by criminals,\r\nby the breeders of horses and dogs, by all kinds of untrained\r\nclumsy-handed men working for their own immediate ends.\r\nI was the first man to take up this question armed with antiseptic surgery,\r\nand with a really scientific knowledge of the laws of growth.\r\nYet one would imagine it must have been practised in secret before.\r\nSuch creatures as the Siamese Twins--And in the vaults of\r\nthe Inquisition.  No doubt their chief aim was artistic torture,\r\nbut some at least of the inquisitors must have had a touch of\r\nscientific curiosity.\"",

His skin followed, most of it in one piece, all of it still living.  The doctor took him apart with exquisite care, like disassembling a flexible, fragile, tremendously complex jigsaw puzzle.  The brain was flashburned and the ashes saved for urn burial; but all the rest of the body, in slabs and small blobs and parchment-thin layers and lengths of tubing, went into storage in the hospital's organ banks. Any one of these units could be packed in a travel case at a moment's notice and flown to anywhere in the world in not much more than an hour.

Certain were mathematical theoreticians, others had made a profound study of the physical sciences.\r\n\r\nSome of these, with a detail of Peasants to perform the sheer physical exertion, attempted to restore the energy-cannon to functioning condition. Unluckily, the cannon had not been maintained in good order. Various components were obviously corroded or damaged. Conceivably these components might have been replaced from the Mek shops on the second \r\nsub-level, but none of the group had any knowledge of the Mek nomenclature or warehousing system. Warrick Madency \r\nArban (which is to say, Arban of the Madency family on the\r\n\r\nWarrick clan) suggested that a work-force of Peasants search the warehouse. But in view of the limited mental capacity of the Peasants, nothing was done and the whole plan to restore the energy-cannon came to naught.\r\n",

Under the funnel was a wooden \r\nplatter, and on this lay a piece of steel about a foot \r\nsquare and six inches thick. There was a strange \r\nlight, which might perhaps be better described as a \r\nradiance rather than a light, falling on the block of \r\nsteel. Another block, exactly similar, lay on one \r\nof the side benches. The Professor turned two \r\nswitches in the table. A humming sound, which \r\nhad pervaded the room when the Kaiser entered, \r\nceased, and the radiance under the projector \r\ndisappeared. \r\n\r\n\" Now, Your Majesty, this is the first experiment, \r\nand I shall ask you to make it yourself. These two \r\nblocks of steel are cut from the same armour-plate, the very finest that can be made at Essen. This one \r\nhas been subjected to the influence of what I call my \r\ndemagnetising rays. That one has not. There is a \r\nhammer and chisel beside it. Will Your Majesty be \r\nkind enough to see if you can make any impression \r\non it.\" \r\n\r\n\"If this is Krupp's best I don't expect I can,\" \r\nlaughed the Kaiser, as he took up the chisel and \r\nhammer and struck a smart blow in the middle of \r\nthe plate. There was not a scratch on the steel, but \r\nthe edge of the chisel was turned. \"Good stuff, \r\nthat,\" he said. \" And that, you say, is from the \r\nsame plate. What do you want me to do with \r\nit?\" \r\n\r\nThe Professor held the wooden platter towards \r\nhim, and said : \" That, Your Majesty, is the best steel \r\nthat Germany can produce. You have not been able \r\nto make a mark on it. This was the same steel, but \r\nit is steel no longer.\" \r\n\r\n\" What do you mean, Herr Professor ? \" interrupted \r\nthe Kaiser with a quick lift of his heavy eyelids. \r\n\" I hope this is not one of the solemn jokes \r\nwhich you scientific gentlemen seem so fond of \r\nmaking? \" \r\n\r\n\" On the contrary, Your Majesty,\" replied the man \r\nof science very seriously, \" I believe it to be the \r\nmost solemn fact that has been discovered since \r\ntribes and nations first went to war with each \r\nother. Will you be good enough to take the hammer and strike this piece of metal lightly in the \r\ncentre.\" \r\n\r\nThe Kaiser took up the hammer and struck the \r\nblock rather smartly. To his utter amazement it \r\nvanished. There was a heap of fine dust on the \r\nplatter, and more falling over the edges on to the \r\nfloor. \r\n\r\n\" Heavens, Professor ! \" he gasped. \" What miracle \r\nis this?\" \r\n\r\n\"There are no miracles, Your Majesty,\" he replied, \r\nputting the platter down on the table, and sweeping \r\nsome of the dust into the palm of his right hand : \r\n\" there are only discoveries. What I have had the \r\nfortune to discover is the fact that, by the influence \r\nof certain electro-ethereal waves, iron and steel may \r\nbe demagnetised. But, to put it more plainly, I \r\nwould say that, as Your Majesty is well aware, the \r\nmolecules composing every substance revolve round \r\neach other in a given direction, but with varying \r\nspeeds. The greater the speed, the harder the \r\nsubstance, and that is why the diamond is the hardest \r\nmaterial known. But, for want of a better term, \r\ndemagnetising a metal slows down these revolu- \r\ntions until they stop and reverse, and therefore, \r\ninstead of cohering, the molecules repel each other. \r\nThus, on the slightest shock, the hardest metal \r\nfalls to dust. This dust, for instance, is composed \r\nof minute particles of iron, nickel, phosphorus, \r\nand carbon, once fused and hardened in oil by Krupp's special process. It has been for a quarter of an hour under the influence of the rays, and Your Majesty sees the result. It is all perfectly simple.\" \r\n",

The habit was vulgar and perhaps faintly improper: it was unproductive of ideas, and had no connection with the habits that really mattered. So respirators were abolished, and with them, of course, the terrestrial motors, and except for a few lecturers, who complained that they were debarred access to their subject- matter, the development was accepted quietly. Those who still wanted to know what the earth was like had after all only to listen to some gramophone, or to look into some cinematophote. And even the lecturers acquiesced when they found that a lecture on the sea was none the less stimulating when compiled out of other lectures that had already been delivered on the same subject.",

Looking now through the eyes of the squat mobile probe, Rawlins got his first view of what lay in Zone H of the maze. He saw a scalloped wall of what looked like puckered blue porcelain undulating away to the left, and a barrier of metallic threads dangling from a thick stone slab to the other side. The drone skirted the threads, which tinkled and quivered in delicate response to the disturbance of the thin air; it moved to the base of the porcelain wall, and followed it at an inward-sloping angle for perhaps twenty meters...\r\n\r\nThe drone was out of the chamber now and shuttling quickly through the place where the light-beam had flashed. Rawlins keyed in olfactory and got the smell of scorched air, lots of ozone. The path divided ahead. To one side was a single-span bridge of stone, arching over what looked like a pit of flame; to the other was a jumbled pile of cyclopean blocks resting precariously edge to edge. The bridge seemed far more inviting, but the drone immediately turned away from it and began to pick its way over the jumbled blocks. Rawlins asked it why, and it relayed the information that the \u0093bridge\u0094 wasn\u0092t there at all; it was a projection beamed from scanners mounted beneath the facing piers. Requesting a simulation of an approach anyway, Rawlins got a picture of the probe walking out onto the pier and stepping unsuspectingly through the solid-looking bridge to lose its balance; and as the simulated probe struggled to regain its equilibrium, the pier tipped forward and shucked it into the fiery pit. Cute, Rawlins thought, and shuddered...\r\n\n",

                    "excerpt": " It surprised him that so much of the city should have survived. Archaeologists had concluded, from a study of the artifacts and skeletons found on Lemnos outside the maze, that there had been no intelligent life here for upward of a million years\u0097perhaps five or six million. Muller was only an amateur archaeologist, but he had had enough field experience to know the effects of the passing of time. The fossils in the plain were clearly ancient, and the stratification of the city\u0092s outer walls showed that the labyrinth was contemporary with those fossils.\r\n   Yet most of the city, supposedly built before the evolution of mankind on Earth, appeared untouched by the ages. The dry weather could account in part for that; there were no storms here, and rain had not fallen since Muller\u0092s arrival. But wind and windblown sand could carve walls and pavements over a million years, and there was no sign of such carving here. Nor had sand accumulated in the open streets of the city. Muller knew why. Hidden pumps collected all debris, keeping everything spotless. He had gathered handfuls of soil from the garden plots, scattering little trails here and there. Within minutes the driblets of soil had begun to slither across the polished pavement, vanishing into slots that opened briefly and closed again at the intersection of buildings and ground.\r\n   Evidently beneath the city lay a network of inconceivable machinery\u0097imperishable caretaker devices that guarded the city against the tooth of time. Muller had not been able to reach that network, though. He lacked the equipment for breaching the pavement; it seemed invulnerable at all points. With improvised tools he had begun to dig in the garden areas, hoping to reach the sub-city that way, but though he had driven one pit more than a dozen feet and another even deeper he had come upon no signs of anything below but more soil. The hidden guardians had to be there, however: the instruments that operated the viewing tanks, swept the streets, repaired the masonry, and controlled the murderous traps that studded the outer zones of the labyrinth.\r\n   It was hard to imagine a race that could build a city of this sort \u0097a city designed to last millions of years. It was harder still to imagine how they could have vanished. Assuming that the fossils found in the burial yards outside the walls were those of the builders\u0097not necessarily a safe assumption\u0097this city had been put together by burly humanoids a meter and a half tall, immensely thick through the chest and shoulders, with long cunning fingers, eight to the hand, and short double-jointed legs.\r\n   They were gone from the known worlds of the universe, and nothing like them had been found in any other system; perhaps they had withdrawn to some far galaxy yet unvisited by man. Or, possibly, they had been a nonspacegoing race that evolved and perished right here on Lemnos, leaving this city as their only monument...\r\n\r\nHad they been invaded by beings for whom the maze posed no problems, and had they been slaughtered in their own sleek streets, and had the mechanical wardens swept away the bones? No way of knowing. They were gone. Muller, entering their city, had found it silent, desolate, as if it had never sheltered life; an automatic city, sterile, flawless. Only beasts occupied it. They had had a million years to find their way through the maze and take possession. Muller had counted some two dozen species of mammals in all sizes from rat-equivalent to elephant-equivalent. There were grazers who munched on the city\u0092s gardens, and hunters who fed on the herbivores, and the ecological balance seemed perfect. The city in the maze was like unto Isaiah\u0092s Babylon: wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.\r\n   The city was his now.",

The ship\u0092s data banks had plenty of mobile extensions: airborne and groundborne drone probes, spy-eyes, sensor batteries, and more. Before any human life was risked on the maze Boardman and Hosteen would try the whole mechanical array. Mechanicals were expendable, anyway; the ship carried a set of templates, and it would be no trouble to replicate all devices destroyed.

The drop-capsule was programmed for a minimum-expenditure orbit that would bring it skimming past the alien in due time, but Muller swiftly discovered that he was deviating from that orbit. Deviations are never accidental. His capsule was accelerating beyond the program, which meant that it had been grasped and was being drawn forward. He accepted that. He was icily calm, expecting nothing and prepared for everything. The drop-capsule eased down. He saw the gleaming bulk of the alien satellite now.\r\n   Skin to metal skin, the vehicles met and touched and joined.",

That told Muller that it had picked up the thermals of an animal in the 50\u0096100 kilogram range. He had the detector programmed to scan in three horizons, of which this was the middle one, the food-beast range. The detector would also report to him on the proximity of 10\u009620 kilogram creatures\u0097the teeth-beast range\u0097and on the emanations of beasts over 500 kilograms\u0097the big-beast range. The small ones had a way of going quickly for the throat, and the great ones were careless tramplers; Muller hunted those in between and avoided the others. \r\n\r\n...He sighted along the barrel of his gun. He was safe. He could wait. Perhaps three minutes went by. The mass detector continued to whine, indicating that the beast was remaining within a hundred-meter radius; the pitch rose slightly from moment to moment as the thermals grew stronger. Muller was in no hurry. He was at one side of a vast plaza bordered by glassy curving partitions, and anything that emerged from those gleaming crescents would be an easy shot. Muller was hunting tonight in Zone E of the maze, the fifth sector out from the heart, and one of the most dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe song of the mass detector reached into the upper end of the pitch spectrum for an animal of this size. The smallest moon, Atropos, swinging giddily through the sky, changed the shadow pattern; the lines no longer converged, but now one bar of blackness cut across the other two. The shadow of a snout, Muller knew. An instant later he saw his victim. The animal was the size of a large dog, gray of muzzle and tawny of body, hump-shouldered, ugly, spectacularly carnivorous.",

In the milky green recesses of the viewing tank he could see the ship and the plastic domes that had sprouted beside it, and the tiny figures of men moving about. He wished now that he had been able to find the fine control on the viewing tank; the images he received were badly out of focus. But he considered himself lucky to have the use of the tank at all. Many of the ancient instruments in this city had become useless long ago through the decay of some vital part. A surprising number had endured the eons unharmed, a tribute to the technical skill of their makers; but of these, Muller had been able to discover the function of only a few, and he operated those imperfectly.\r\n\r\n   He watched the blurred figures of his fellow humans working busily and wondered what new torment they were preparing for him.\r\n\r\nHe eyed the screens. He occupied a squat hexagonal cell\u0097apparently one of the housing units in the inner city\u0097which was equipped with a wall of viewing tanks. It had taken him more than a year to find out which parts of the maze corresponded to the images on the screens; but by patiently posting markers he had matched the dim images to the glossy reality. The six lowest screens along the wall showed him pictures of areas in Zones A through F; the cameras, or whatever they were, swiveled through 180\u00b0 arcs, enabling the hidden mysterious eyes to patrol the entire region around each of the zone entrances. Since only one entrance provided safe access to the zone within, all others being lethal, the screens effectively allowed Muller to watch the inward progress of any prowler. It did not matter what was taking place at any of the false entrances. Those who persisted there would die.\r\n   Screens seven through ten, in the upper bank, relayed images that apparently came from Zones G and H, the outermost, largest and deadliest zones of the maze. Muller had not wanted to go to the trouble of returning to those zones to check his theory in detail; he was satisfied that the screens were pickups from points in the outer zones, and it was not worth risking those zones again to find out more accurately where the pickups were mounted. As for the eleventh and twelfth screens, they obviously showed views of the plain outside the maze altogether\u0097the plain now occupied by a newly-arrived starship from Earth.",

The track of the catapult crawled in a straight line up the face of the mountain, whole shoulders having been carved away to permit it. At the \r\ntemporary space port, still raw from construction, Harriman, in company with visiting notables, was saying good-bye to the passengers and crew of the Mayflower.\r\n\r\nThe crowds came right up to the rail of the catapult. There was no need to keep them back from the ship; the jets would not blast until she was high over the peak. Only the ship itself was guarded, the ship and the gleaming rails...\r\n\r\nThe outer door was closed; ready lights winked along the track and from the control tower. A siren sounded.\r\nHarriman moved a step or two closer.\r\n\r\n\"There she goes!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a shout from the whole crowd. The great ship started slowly, softly up the track, gathered speed, and shot toward the distant peak. She was already tiny by the time she curved up the face and burst into the sky.\r\n\r\nShe hung there a split second, then a plume of light exploded from her tail. Her jets had fired.\r\n\r\nThen she was a shining light in the sky, a ball of flame, then-nothing. She was gone, upward and outward, to her rendezvous with her tankers.",

Matter is made up of molecules and molecules, in their turn, are made up of atoms. The atom, you know, is the unit of being... Their dissolution may be accomplished by chemical affinity or by a sufficiently strong electric current...\"\r\n\r\n\"There was no reason why matter could not be telegraphed, or to be etymologically accurate, 'telepomped.' It was only necessary to effect at one end of the line the disintegration of the molecules into atoms and to convey the vibrations of the chemical dissolution by electricity to the other pole, whhere a corresponding reconstruction could be effected from other atoms. As all atoms are alike, their arrangement into molecules of the same order, and the arrangement of those molecules into an organization similar to the original organization, would be practically a reproduction of the original. It would be a materialization - not in the sense of the spiritualist's cant, but in all the truth and logic of stern science.\"",

The weather box on the front door sang quietly: \"Rain, rain, go away; rubbers, raincoats for today...\" \r\n\r\nAnd the rain tapped on the empty house, echoing. Outside, the garage chimed and lifted its door to reveal the waiting car. After a long wait the door swung down again. At eight-thirty the eggs were shriveled and the toast was like stone. An aluminum wedge scraped them into the sink, where hot water whirled them down a metal throat which digested and flushed them away to the distant sea. The dirty dishes were dropped into a hot washer and emerged twinkling dry. \r\n\r\nNine-fifteen, sang the clock, time to clean. Out of warrens in the wall, tiny robot mice darted. The rooms were acrawl with the small cleaning animals, all rubber and metal. They thudded against chairs, whirling their mustached runners, kneading the rug nap, sucking gently at hidden dust.

I can do it!\" He shoved her in, jumped in behind her, and flapped the tiller, let the cobalt sail up to take the evening wind. The stars were bright and the blue Martian ships were skimming across the whispering sands. At first his own ship would not move, then he remembered the sand anchor and yanked it in. \r\n\"There!\" The wind hurled the sand ship keening over the dead sea bottom, over long-buried crystals, past upended pillars, past deserted docks of marble and brass, past dead white chess cities, past purple foothills, into distance. The figures of the Martian ships receded and then began to pace Sam's ship. ... \r\nThe blue phantom ships loomed up behind them, drawing steadily apace. He did not see them at first. He was only aware of a whistling and a high windy screaming, as of steel on sand, and it was the sound of the sharp razor prows of the sand ships preening the sea bottoms, their red pennants, blue pennants unfurled. In the blue light ships were blue dark images, masked men, men with silvery faces, men with blue stars for eyes, men with carved golden ears, men with tinfoil cheeks and ruby-studded lips, men with arms folded, men following him, Martian men. \r\n... Now the great ships turned as lightly as moon thistles. Their wing-sails flapped with a sound of soft applause on the air. The masks were coruscating, turning, firing the shadows. \r\n... In the blowing moonlight, like metal petals of some ancient flower, like blue plumes, like cobalt butterflies immense and quiet, the old ships turned and moved over the shifting sands, the masks beaming and glittering, until the last shine, the last blue color, was lost among the hills.",

I \r\nremembered the uneasiness with which \r\nI heard it. And when I saw several of \r\nthem (house-servants of mine) whispering together, I was filled with alarm. \r\n'Come!' I said sharply, 'stop loitering; \r\nget your work done.' They stared at \r\nme. That is a funny thing to say of \r\nmetal cylinders.

The Behavorists claim it is reflex action. What is language? It is the marshalling of our reflex actions in words. Animals may \r\n\"think\", remember, but lacking a vocabulary save of the most primitive kind (a \r\nmatter of laryngeal structure), their \r\nthinking, their remembering, is on the \r\nwhole vague and fleeting, incoherent. But \r\nMan, by means of words, has widened \r\nthe scope of his thinking, remembering, \r\nhas created philosophy, literature, poetry, \r\npainting, has made possible civilization, the industrial era. Vocabulary \u0097 \r\nthe ability to fix his reflex actions into \r\ncoherent speech \u0097 has crowned him supreme among animals. But now comes \r\nthe Mentanical of his own creation, \r\nevolving language in its turn. Without \r\nspeech the Mentanical was, to all intents \r\nand purposes, thoughtless and obedient, \r\nas thoughtless and obedient as trained \r\ndomestic animals. But with vocabulary \r\ncomes memory and the ability to think. \r\nWhat effect will this evolving faculty \r\nhave on Man, what problems, dangers, \r\nwill it pose for him in the near future?\" \r\n\r\n\"So wrote Bane Borgson, seventy \r\nyears of age, fifteen years after his invention of the multiple mechanical-cell, \r\nand \u0097 God help us ! \u0097 we had not long \r\nto wait for the Mentanicals to supply \r\nan answer to his questions. \r\n\r\n\"I have told of the whispering of: \r\nmy servants. That was a disquieting \r\nthing. But more disquieting still it was \r\nto hear that whispering coming over the \r\nradio, the telephone, to observe cylindrical Mentanicals listening, answering. \r\nFrankenstein must have felt as I felt \r\nin those days. During that period, \r\nwhich lasted several years, things went \r\nsmoothly enough; to a great extent people became accustomed to the phenomenon and decided \u0097 save for a few \r\nmen and women here and there, like \r\nto myself \u0097 that the whispering was an \r\nidiosyncrasy of the Mentanicals, implicit \r\nin their make-up, and that the various \r\nscientists and thinkers who wrote and \r\ntalked with foreboding were theorists \r\nand alarmists of the extremest type. Indeed there were certain scientists and \r\nphilosophers of reputation, who maintained them in this belief. Then came \r\nthe first blow : The Mentanical servants \r\nceased waiting on man! \r\n\r\nTo understand the terrible nature \r\nX of this defection, one must understand how dependant humanity had become on the Mentanicals, In those days \r\nhuman toilers were relatively few in \r\nnumber, laboring under the direction of \r\nthe Mentanical superintendents and also \r\nguards (in the bloody wars of a decade \r\nbefore\u0097 and the ones preceding them \u0097 \r\nthe ranks of labor had been woefully decimated) ; and it was estimated that the \r\ngrowth of the machine had lifted, and \r\nwas still lifting, millions of workers into \r\nthe leisure class. The dream of the \r\nTechnocrats \u0097 a group of pseudo-scientists and engineers who held forth in \r\n1932-33\u0097seemed about to be fulfilled. \r\n\"But when the Mentanicals struck, the \r\nwhole fabric of this new system swayed, \r\ntottered. Food ceased coming into the \r\ncities, distribution of food supplies \r\nstopped. Not at first did starvation \r\ntin-eaten. Men and women fetched food \r\nfrom the supply depots. But in a few \r\nweeks these depots were emptied of their \r\ncontents. Then famine threatened, not \r\nalone in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Montreal, but in the great cities \r\nof Europe. The strange, the weird thing \r\nabout it all was that men were still able \r\nto talk to one another from city to \r\ncity. Boston spoke to Los Angeles, and \r\nBuda-Pest to Warsaw. Listeners tuned \r\nin with receiving sets, speakers broadcasted through microphones and the \r\nnewly improved television-cabinet ; but \r\nthe grim spectre of want soon drove \r\nthem from those instruments, and, in \r\nthe end, city was cut off from city, and country was separated from country.",

They came \r\ngliding from one of the openings in \r\nan upright fashion, and this was the \r\nsingular thing about them, that their \r\nmeans of locomotion were not apparent \r\nto the eye. There were no wheels or \r\ntreads. They appeared to skim the stone \r\nor concrete with which the square was \r\npaved, rather than touch it. Oddly repellant they were, and intimidating, and \r\nI loosened the automatic in its shoulder \r\nholster \u0097 the small one I always carry \u0097 \r\nand prepared for emergencies, though \r\nbullets were useless against the cylinders \r\nas I was to discover later. \r\n\n\n\n(Mentanicals cover art)\n\n\r\nTHE cylinders were smooth things \r\nabout five feet tall, of a dulled metal \r\nhue, with here and there shining spots \r\nwhich constantly waxed and waned in color. They were machines \u0097 I thought \r\nof them as machines \u0097 and it was reasonable to suppose that behind them \r\nlurked a human intelligence. The people \r\nof the future, I thought, have invented \r\ndevices unknown to us of the Twentieth \r\nCentury; and it came over me how wonderful it was going to be to meet those \r\nsuperior people, talk to them, gaze upon \r\nthe marvels with which they had surrounded themselves. \r\n\r\nSo I went to meet the cylinders. \r\n\r\nTheir soft whispering meant nothing to me at first. Nor at first did I \r\nsuspect the source of the gentle pressure running over me from head to \r\nfoot, as the cylinders came close. Then \r\nwith an odd thrill of apprehension I \r\nrealized that the curious cylinders were \r\nhandling, examining me, that from them \r\nemanated an electrical force, a manipulation of invisible rays which functioned \r\nas organs of touch. Alone, bewildered, \r\ntrying vainly to comprehend the strange \r\nsituation, I had to call on every ounce \r\nof my self-control to remain calm. Yes, \r\nI was afraid \u0097 only the fool says he \r\nnever is \u0097 but more afraid of being \r\nafraid, of showing fear. I still believed \r\nthat behind those cylinders must lurk a \r\nhuman intelligence. The genius of the \r\nrace seemed to run along the line of \r\nmaking robots. There was the \"metal \r\nbrain\" at Washington, that told of the \r\ntides, the electrical eye which watched \r\na thousand industrial processes, a myriad \r\nautomatic devices functioning with little \r\nor no supervision from man ; and of \r\ncourse I had read the play \"R. U. R.,\" \r\nscience fiction stories dealing with the \r\nfuture of machinery, and it was inevitable \u0097 strange, and yet not so strange \u0097 \r\nthat I should expect an advancement, \r\na realization of all those things in the \r\nfuture. Man the inventor, I thought, \r\nhad achieved them; and for a moment \r\nthis belief seemed borne out when I \r\nsaw the men. \r\n\r\nThe cylinders seemed watching attentively, listening. I don't know how, but \r\nthey gave me that impression; and now \r\nI noticed that the shining spots on them \r\nwere glowing intensely, that their whispering was not a steady but a modulated \r\nsound. As if it were language, I thought, \r\nlanguage! and a strange dread came over \r\nme and I shivered as if with cold.",

It was his theory that the sensations of the nervous system are flashed to the brain as electric currents, or vibrations, and that it was the action of these vibratory currents on the brain-stuff that caused consciousness and thought. Thus, instead of trying to make simple, living cells and from them work up the complicated structure of the brain, he had constructed an organ, a brain, of metal, entirely inorganic and lifeless, yet whose atomic structure he claimed was analogous to the atomic structure of a living brain. He had then applied countless different electrical vibrations to this metallic brain-stuff, and finally announced that under vibrations of certain frequencies the organ had showed faint signs of consciousness.",

There is an artificial retina beneath and it is connected direct to the brain-stuff, and carries its sensations to it, as electric currents.\r\n\"An artificial retina?\" asked Lanier. \"Isn't that going a bit too far? An inorganic material sensitive to light?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you never hear of a substance called selenium?\" asked Detmold with fine sarcasm, as as Lanier started, he added, \"Ah, you begin to see!

It gave to the touch a slight sensation of warmth\u0097how can I describe it?\u0097a warmth that was living.\r\n\r\nI weighed it in my hand. It was oddly heavy, twice the weight, I should say, of platinum. I drew out a glass and examined it. Decidedly the pyramid was metallic, but of finest, almost silken texture\u0097and I could not place it among any of the known metals. It certainly was none I had ever seen; yet it was as certainly metal. It was striated\u0097slender filaments radiating from tiny, dully lustrous points within the polished surface.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly I had the weird feeling that each of these points was an eye, peering up at me, scrutinizing me...\r\n\r\nFaster the cubes moved; faster the circle revolved; the pyramids raised themselves, stood bolt upright on their square bases; the six rolling spheres touched them, joined the spinning, and with sleight-of-hand suddenness the ring drew together; its units coalesced, cubes and pyramids and globes threading with a curious suggestion of ferment.\r\n\r\nWith the same startling abruptness there stood erect, where but a moment before they had seethed, a little figure, grotesque; a weirdly humorous, a vaguely terrifying foot-high shape, squared and angled and pointed and ANIMATE\u0097as though a child should build from nursery blocks a fantastic shape which abruptly is filled with throbbing life.\r\n\r\nAgain the sibilant rustling\u0097and cubes and pyramids and spheres were gone.\r\n\r\n\"Goodwin!\" he whispered. \"What\u0097what were they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Metal,\" I said\u0097it was the only word to which my whirling mind could cling\u0097\"metal\u0097\"\r\n\r\n\"Metal!\" he echoed. \"These things metal?

You used them. If necessary, you drove yourself to the edge of breakdown to use them; you made every breath a burden and every hour a torment to use them, until through diligent consuming and/or occupational merit, you were promoted to the next higher class, and were allowed to consume less frantically. But you didn\u0092t wantonly destroy or throw out. You consumed.\r\n\r\nMorey thought fearfully: When the Board finds out about this\u0085\r\n\r\nStill, he reminded himself, the Board hadn\u0092t found out. It might take some time before they did, for humans, after all, never entered robot quarters. There was no law against it, not even a sacrosanct custom. But there was no reason to. When breaks occurred, which was infrequently, maintenance robots or repair squads came in and put them back in order.

In a fraction of a second the room was in utter blackness, a jet \r\nnight so intense that the powerful glow lamps of the laboratory were utterly \r\nlost. There was nothing but a solid, impenetrable wall of blankness.\r\n\t\"Good lord, what is that?\" gasped Aarn. \"Hey--where in blazes are you? I \r\ncan't--say, I can't see my hand when it's touching my face. Uh--here's a light \r\nnow--\"\r\n\tSilence. A chuckle from Spencer. \"It won't work--\"\r\n\t\"Haw!\" Spencer looked at the screen of his heat-eye televisor, and grinned wider.\r\n\tAs though through a slight, bright fog, he could see Aarn, shining brightly, \r\nand holding a flash-lamp that was shining equally brightly, but seemed to be \r\ncuriously affected by the fog. \"It's working. It just can't light, can't send \r\na beam. Put it about half an inch from your eye, and you can see it.\"\r\n\tAarn did. \"Sweet singing satellites--what a fog that ink makes! What in space \r\nis it?\"\r\n\t\"Infra-infra-infra fluorescence.\" Spencer grinned. \"And your heat-eye works \r\nbeautifully. That's what friend Carlisle made for the occasion of our raid. \r\nThe chemical tanks contain a load of this. It combines with the oxygen of the \r\nair to form a chemical dye in particles so tiny they are close to the brownian \r\nlimits, and won't settle out in less than about three hours under Tell-el's \r\ngravity.\"\r\n\t\"Infra-infra-and so forth. I think I commence to under stand. Will you kindly \r\nsupply me with one of those heat visors so I can see my way out? What do you \r\ndo to use it in this?\"\r\n\t\"Stick it so close to your eyes, and turn it up so far that you can see it. \r\nThis fog isn't utterly impenetrable, you know.\"\r\n\t\"No--but if I am right, it would be darned near it. I take it that this stuff \r\nacts the way fluorescence does with ultra violet. It takes ultra-violet, and \r\nreduces it to visible light. This takes visible, and reduces it to \r\ninfra-visible. Right?\"\r\n\t\"Quite right. The heat-visor is somewhat obscured, be cause that re-radiation \r\nof heat by the little particles of the dye makes a foglike breaking up of the \r\nlight, and also the heat.\"",

The inner surface was evidently a parabolic one, made up of a maze of tiny coils, each oriented carefully toward some definite aim, while the entire rim of the \"soup dish\" was a single larger coil. Carefully Aarn adjusted it so that it pointed toward the flickering cage of copper wires, and beyond it to the apparatus at the other end of the bench. This apparatus seemed fairly simple, merely a number of standards with various arrangements of wires. Two parallel copper bars, a double spiral made of two insulated wires, two metal disks. \r\n\r\n\"Those,\" said Aarn softly, \"are simply connected with the normal power supply. It is alternating current of sixty cycles at two hundred and twenty volts. The device I have is a pickup. It will collect the power from those wires. The projector here is the real secret-it makes space itself become a perfect conductor of electric-space-strain. Not electricity. Electric-space-strain. But the result is the same. It makes the space along its axis capable of carrying power along the axis-and along the axis only. When I start this, the space between here and that interrupter coil back there will be come a perfect conductor. The interrupter coil is necessary to prevent the thing reaching on, out indefinitely...\"",

Sure, catapults are mostly vacuum; stator\r\nrings aren't even close together at ejection end. But Authority's 3-g catapult was almost one hundred kilometers long.

It showed up beautifully on a radar screen.\r\n\r\nWe were building a shorter catapult, a 10-g job, but even that was thirty kilometers long, too big to hide... We hid it in literal sense, too; this catapult had to be underground, so that it would not show to eye or radar.

Chlorophyll, of course, is the green coloring matter of plants which has the peculiar property of transforming carbon dioxide gas, water, and the sun's energy, into starches and sugars which are available for assimilation by the animal world. All of our food supplies, save those produced in the laboratory by the direct conversion of energy into matter, are derived from this source. The method is round about and very uneconomical. First the energy must be converted into sugars and starches with the waste attendant on all forms of metabolism and then it must be reconverted into animal tissues with another large percentage waste. Sometimes it is allowed to go through still another step, as occurs when we feed plans to animals and then eat the products of the animal life in the form of eggs, milk and meat. In such a case, not over one-half of one per cent of the initial energy taken from the sun ever goes into the animal tissue. It is my hope to remedy this situation and eliminate the waste.\r\n\r\n\"Chlorophyll is a very complex substance. The Sub-committee is familiar with the work that I did some thirty years ago, when I revolutionized plant husbandry thus enabling five crops of grain a year to be raised on land that formerly produced but only one crop. This was done by substituting for some of the nitrogen atoms in normal chlorophyll, an atom of radium, and by decreasing by four, the number of carbon atoms with corresponding decreases in the oxygen and hydrogen atoms. The result was a substance which is five times as efficient as chlorophyll and which differs from hematin in the location of the double bonds connecting some of the atoms. For the benefit of the members of the Press, I will state that hematin is one of the constituents of hemoglobin, the red coloring matter of the blood which enables the carbon dioxide produced in the body to be eliminated by way of the lungs. Hemoglobin consists of hematin and of globin, a basic protein.\r\n\r\n\"It is my opinion that it is possible to replace that hematin of the blood by superchlorophyll or some related substance and thus enable mankind to utilize directly the energy derived from the sun. Should my theory be correct, mankind can subsist on water and a small amount of dissolved mineral matter with the aid of sunlight. Agriculture will be unnecessary and the enormous space devoted to raising of plants can be utilized for dwelling space. The food supply of this world will be increased by over five thousand per cent and the danger of a world-wide starvation removed. The idea of realizing the free energy of atoms is idealistic. It has been attempted for the last century and a half without material success. It is improbable that the problem can be solved in time to be of any value in the impending crisis. On the other hand, success has crowned my efforts along the lines of plant biology and I believe that in five years I can solve my problem. I therefore request authority from the Sub-Committee to work on my theory and ask for space, funds and assistants to carry on the work.\"",

It seemed to indicate that she was going to Mercury or Venus, since these were the only places where null-suits were necessary to get by. She curiously fingered the small metal flower below her collarbone, which was the air exhaust valve and control unit of the suit, as Mari explained how to operate it. She had a slight soreness in her neck where Mari had installed the binaural radio and voder that went with the suit...\r\n\r\nA null-suit was not easy to get used to. Some of it was merely disconcerting, such as finding yourself wrapped in a mirror that followed every curve of your body at a distance of one to one and a half millimeters. When she looked at herself, what she saw was a distorted picture of the things around her, twisted like a funhouse mirror. But some of it was downright alarming. Lilo had been breathing air for fifty-seven years, and suddenly to stop was not easy.\r\n\r\nThe suit contained a neural link that suppressed the part of the automatic nervous system that controlled her diaphragm. When the suit was on, the breathing reflex was turned off. But it was not quite that simple. Below even the level where digestion, heartbeat, and breathing are controlled was a primitive ape that was just smart enough to realize she was not breathing, but not smart enough to understand the suit was taking care of it. The result was a near-panic reaction...\r\n\r\n\r\n... She visualized the irregular metal implant Mari had put in place of her left lung. It contained the nullfield generator, a thirty-hour supply of oxygen, and artificial alveoli that connected with her pulmonary circulation system. The null-suit exchanged oxygen for carbon dioxide, but much more efficiently than her lungs could. The oscillation of her suit's field created a bellows action that forced nearly pure carbon dioxide from the exhaust valve under her collarbone.",

It begins with the opening bolt of lightning. I worked on it a long time, and designed it to shatter nerves. There is the slow building of thunderheads ... then it hits. It crashes in at seventeen points in a ring around the audience, none further away than a half a kilometer. It is poperly called chain lightning, because after the initial discharge it keeps flashing for a full seven seconds.

To be sure, it is like television in the sense that it enables one to see things at a distance, but the essential difference between the Teleview and a Televisor is this: For\r\nTelevision it is necessary to have both a sending and a receiving apparatus and it cannot be used except in places where the object to be seen can be brought to the sending station or where the sending\r\nstation can be brought to the event which is to be\r\ntransmitted over a distance. \r\n\r\n\u0093The Teleview is not hedged in by any such restrictions. All the apparatus is concentrated at the\r\nreceiving end. No sending set is required. Within\r\ncertain limits, it may be focused on any spot so that one actually sees the events themselves, exactly\r\nas they happen.\u0094 \r\n\r\n\u0093Do you mean to tell me that you can focus your\r\napparatus on something that is happening in India\r\nor Arabia and be able to see it here at the very instant it is taking place over there?\u0094 I asked\r\ndoubtfully. \r\n\n\n\n(The Phantom Teleview)\n\n\r\n\u0093The task you have outlined cannot be performed\r\nquite yet, for the simple reason that the places you\r\nmentioned are on the opposite side of the earth. However, even that can easily be accomplished when we have established stations at four or five strategic points around the earth, so that we will be\r\nable to pick up any event, no matter where it happens and relay it on to our other stations. \r\n\r\n\u0093At present, this station has the only Teleview\r\napparatus in existence. The range of this set is limited only by the curvature of the earth. With\r\nit I can get most of Europe and the western part\r\nof Africa to the east and the coast of Asia on the\r\nwest. Naturally anything in the United States or\r\nin the portion of the. Pacific north of the Equator\r\ncan easily be focused in.\u0094",

His and Paul's attention had wandered to the largest color photo thumbtacked to the wall, above the TV set, and the shelf of dog-eared technical books. It showed a fragile, pearly ring, almost diaphanous, hanging tilted against spatial blackness and pinpoint stars. Its hub was a cylindrical spindle, with radial guys of fine, stainless steel wire. It was like the earliest ideas about a space station, yet it was also different. To many\u0097Frank Nelsen and Paul Hendricks certainly included\u0097such devices had as much beauty as a yacht under full sail had ever had for anybody.\r\n\r\nOld Paul smirked with pleasure. \"It's a shame, ain't it, Frank\u0097calling a pretty thing like that a 'bubb'\u0097it's an ugly p. 17 word. Or even a 'space bubble.' Technical talk gets kind of cheap.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind,\" Frank Nelsen answered. \"Our first one, here, could look just as nice\u0097inflated, and riding free against the stars.\"\r\n\r\nHe touched the crinkly material, draped across its wooden support.\r\n\r\n\"It will,\" the old man promised. \"Funny\u0097not so long ago people thought that space ships would have to be really rigid\u0097all metal. So how did they turn out? Made of stellene, mostly\u0097an improved form of polyethylene\u0097almost the same stuff as a weather balloon.\"\r\n\r\n\"A few millimeters thick, light, perfectly flexible when deflated,\" Nelsen added. \"Cut out and cement your bubb together in any shape you choose. Fold it up firmly, like a parachute\u0097it makes a small package that can be carried up into orbit in a blastoff rocket with the best efficiency. There, attached flasks of breathable atmosphere fill it out in a minute. Eight pounds pressure makes it fairly solid in a vacuum. So, behold\u0097you've got breathing and living room, inside. There's nylon cording for increased strength\u0097as in an automobile tire\u0097though not nearly as much. There's a silicone gum between the thin double layers, to seal possible meteor punctures. A darkening lead-salt impregnation in the otherwise transparent stellene cuts radiation entry below the danger level, and filters the glare and the hard ultra-violet out of the sunshine. So there you are, all set up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rig your hub and guy wires,\" old Paul carried on, cheerfully. \"Attach your sun-powered ionic drive, set up your air-restorer, spin your vehicle for centrifuge-gravity, and you're ready to move\u0097out of orbit.\"\r\n\r\nThey laughed, because getting into space wasn't as easy as they made it sound. The bubbs, one of the basic inventions that made interplanetary travel possible, were, for all their almost vagabondish simplicity, still a concession in lightness and compactness for atmospheric transit, to that first and greatest problem\u0097breaking the terrific initial grip of Earth's gravity from the ground upward, and gaining stable orbital speed. Only a tremendously costly rocket, with a thrust greater than its own weight when fully loaded, could do that. Buying a blastoff passage had to be expensive.",

With a folded newspaper raised to his forehead in an odd defensive gesture, he came down the steps of the grey trailer onto the grass and paused. The door of Number 17 where he lived, beckoned him; but competing with the wish to go and hide himself was a desire to overhear what the three men were saying.\r\n\r\n\"Such a gross imposition could only be swung onto a politically indifferent electorate,\" one said.\r\n\r\nThe second, lacking words to express what he though of this sentiment, guffawed immoderately.\r\n\r\n\"Rubbish!\" the third exclaimed. \"You heard what the Minister of Health said the other day: this is just what\u0092s needed to give Britain back her old sense of direction.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the turn of the first man to burst into mocking laughter. Seeing Jimmy standing nearby, they turned to stare curiously at his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"What\u0092s it feel like, mate?\" one of them called.\r\n\r\n\"You really don\u0092t feel a thing,\" Jimmy said, and hastened across the square with his newspaper still half-heartedly raised.\r\n\r\nHe let himself into Number 17. From the hall he could hear Mrs Pidney, the landlady, drowsily humming like a drowned top in the kitchen. The rest was silence. Reassured, Jimmy discarded his paper, revealing the disc on his forehead, and went up to the flat he shared with his brother. Fortunately Aubrey Solent was out, working late at the BIL; that undoubtedly saved Jimmy an awkward scene. Aubrey had grown uncommonly touchy of recent weeks.\r\n\r\nThe flat contained the usual facilities, a kitchen, a living room (with dinerette), Aubrey\u0092s large bedroom and Jimmy\u0092s smaller bedroom. Everything was so tidy that the one glossy-jacketed LP lying in the middle of the carpet looked to be posing. Skirting it, Jimmy hurried into his room and closed the door.\r\n\r\nJust for a moment he played a tune on the panelling with his fingertips. Then he crossed to the looking glass and surveyed himself. The suit Harrods had made him before he began his new job in January was daily growing to look better on him, more like him; for the rest he was twenty-five, his brown hair not objectionably curly, his face round but no ugly, his chin neither aggressive nor recessive.\r\n\r\nAll, in fact, he told himself, sighing, alarmingly ordinary. \"Oh ye of the average everything,\" he addressed himself, improvising, as he frequently did, a rhymed oration, \"Oh, ye of the average height, overtaken by taller folk, undertaken by smaller folk\u0085 an average fate one might certainly call a joke.\"\r\n\r\nOne feature only was definitely not, as yet all events, ordinary: the shining circle. Three and a half centimetres in diameter, permanently fixed in the centre of his forehead. Made of a metal resembling stainless steel, its surface was slightly convex, so that it gave a vague and distorted image of the world before it.",

A tiny, bright point of violet-red fire, with a white line running from it, back to the center of the sphere. The purple spark grew, the white line lengthened. Abruptly, the newspaperman realized that the purple was an object hurtling toward him with incredible speed.\r\n\r\nEven as the realization burst upon him, the spark became visible as a little red-blue sphere, brightly luminous. A white beam shone behind it, seemed to push it with ever-increasing velocity. The purple globe\r\nshot past, vanished. The white ray snapped out...\r\n\r\n\"A solid projectile !\" Brand cried. \"And driven on the positive ray! Our experts have tried it, but the ray always exploded the shell...\"",

                    "excerpt": "\"The City of Space is in a cylinder,\" Captain Smith said. \"Roughly five thousand feet in diameter, and about that high. it is built largely of meteoric iron which we captured from a meteoric swarm making navigation safe and getting useful metal at the same time.  The cylinder whirls constantly, with such speed that the centrifugal force against the sides equals the force of gravity on the earth.  The city is built around the inside of the cylinder - so that one can look up and see his neighbor's house, apparently upside down, a mile above his head.  We enter through a lock in one end of the cylinder.\"\r\n\r\nA vast disk of dull black metal was now visible a few yards outside the vitrolite panels. A huge metal valve swung open in it, revealing a bright space beyond. The Red Rover moved into the chamber, the mighty valve closed behind her, air hissed in about her, an inner valve was opened, and she slipped into the City of Space.\r\n\r\nThey were, Bill saw, at the center of an enormous cylinder. The sides, half a mile away, above and below them, were covered with buildings along neat, tree-bordered streets, scattered with green lawns, tiny gardens, and bits of wooded park. It seemed very strange to Bill, to see these endless streets about the inside of a tube, so that one by walking a little over three miles in one direction would arrive again at the starting point, in the same way that one gets back to the starting point after going around the earth in one direction.\r\n\r\nAt the ends of the cylinder, fastened to the huge metal disks, which closed the ends, were elaborate and complex mechanisms, machines strange and massive. \"They must be for heating the city,\" Bill thought, \"and for purifying the air, for furnishing light and power, perhaps even for moving it about.\" The lock through which they had entered was part of this mechanism.\r\nIn the center of each end of the cylinder hung a huge light, seeming large and round as the sun, flooding the place with brilliant mellow rays...\r\n\r\nThey entered an elevator. Three minutes later they stepped off upon the side of the great cylinder that housed the City, and en- tered a low building with a broad concrete road curving up before it. As they stepped out, it gave Bill a curious dizzy feeling to look up and see busy streets, inverted, a mile above his head. The road before them curved smoothly up on either hand, bordered with beautiful trees, until its ends met again above his head.\r\n\r\nThe centrifugal force that held objects against the\r\nsides of the cylinder acted in precisely the same way as\r\ngravity on the earth\u0097except that it pulled away from the center of the cylinder, instead of toward it.",

Built of steel and the new aluminum bronzes, with broad vision panels of heavy vitrolite, each carried sixteen huge positive ray tubes. These mammoth vacuum tubes, operated at enormous voltages from vitalium batteries, were little different in principle from the \"canal ray\" apparatus of some centuries before. Their \"positive rays,\" or streams of atoms which had lost one or more electrons, served to drive the sunship by reaction\u0097by the well-known principle of the rocket motor.\r\n\r\nAnd the sixteen tubes mounted in twin rings about\r\neach vessel served equally well as weapons. When focused on a point, the impact-pressure of their rays equaled that of the projectile from an ancient cannon. Metal in the positive ray is heated to fusion, living matter carbonized and burned away. And the positive charge carried by the ray is sufficient to electrocute any living being in contact with it.

Under the sun's rays vitalium undergoes a change to triatomic form, storing up the vast energy of sunlight. The vitalium plates from the sunshine are built into batteries with alternate sheets of copper, from which the solar energy may be drawn in the form of electric current. As the battery discharges, the vitalium reverts to its stabler allotropic form, and may be used again and again. The Vitalium Power Company's plants in Arizona, Chili, Australia, the Sahara, and the Gobi now furnish most of the earth's power.",

It was a discus in shape and of great size; it was tilled slightly toward us, for it had grounded partly on one of the magnificent high-stilted old mansions which line that coast.\r\n\r\nThe ship's canted attitude let us see that the upper surface and what was surely its airlock-a metal hemisphere, a dozen feet across, at the main axis of the ship, where the hub would have been had it been a wheel. This hemisphere was lifted straight out or up from the body of the ship some six or eight feet. I could not see what held it out from the hull but I assumed that there must be a central shaft or piston; it came out like a poppet valve.\r\n\r\n    It was easy to see why the masters of the saucer had not closed up again and taken off from there; the airlock was fouled, held open by a \"mud turtle\", one of those little amphibious tanks which are at home on the bottom of a harbor or crawling up onto a beach...\r\n",

The light of the sun, or any light, for that matter, was concentrated through the lens onto a series of photo-electric cells, composed of an alloy of selenium and the far more delicate element, illinium. A high tension current was there created, of such powerful intensity that it disintegrated the atoms of every element except osmium and indium into their constituent electrons. \r\n\r\nConsequently the interior as well as the long slit nozzle orifice at the other end, were made of these resistant metals. Through a special process the tremendously powerful current was forced through the wide-angled nozzle in a spreading thin plate ray that sheared through earth and rock and metals as if they were butter. \r\n\r\nSuch was the machine we were after.",

Almost man-form it was\u0097two tall metal cylinders supporting a larger, that soared aloft till far above it was topped by a many-faceted ball of transparent quartz. Again I had a fleeting, but vivid, impression of something baleful, threatening, about it. Small wonder, though. For the largest cylinder, the trunk of the man-machine Keston had created, was covered thick with dangling arms. And the light of the xenon tube that flooded the screened space was reflected from the great glass head till it seemed that the thing was alive; that it was watching me till some unguarded moment would give it its chance\u0085\r\n\r\nKeston strode to the canvas screen and pulled a cord. The great canvas curtains rolled back. \u0093Here is the machine, my Lords!\u0094 His face was lit with the glow of pride of achievement. His voice had lost its reverence. Rapidly he continued: \u0093The head of this contrivance is a bank of photo and sono-electric cells, each facet focussed on one of the screens. Through a nerve-system of copper filaments any combination of lights and sounds will actuate the proper arm which will shoot out to the required bank of buttons and press the ones necessary to meet any particular demand.\r\n\r\nThe chief wheeled to the master machine and pressed a button. Instantly, the hundreds of dangling arms telescoped out, each to a button bank where a moment before a prolat had labored. And, with a weird simulation of life, the ten forked ends of each arm commenced a rattling pressing of the buttons. Rapidly, purposefully, the metallic fingers moved over the key-boards, and on the screens we could see that the machines all over the world were continuing on their even course. Not the slightest change in their working betrayed the fact that they were now being directed by a machine instead of human beings.",

But, when I had almost completed my second experimental model, I found that I was out of the copper filaments necessary to wind a certain coil. I didn\u0092t want to wait till I could obtain more from the stores, and remembered that on the inside of the door to the Death Bath there was some fine screening that could be dispensed with. I used the wire from that. Whether the secret of life as well as of death lies in those waste rays from the sun, or whether some unknown element of the humans consumed in the flame was deposited on the screening in a sort of invisible coating, I do not know. But this I do know: when that second model was finished, and the vitalizing current was turned on, things happened\u0097queer things that could be explained only on the ground that the machine had intelligence.\u0094\r\n\r\n\u0093I incorporated my new thought coil, as I called it, in the large master machine. But I don\u0092t know just what will happen when the current flows through that. So I shunted it. The machine will work, routinely, without it. There is a button that will bring it into action. When I shall have taken the proper precautions I will switch it on, and then we shall see what happens.\u0094\r\n",

The craters, the hillocks and the boulders were all covered in the midnight-black gleam of glare ice as seen by starlight. Here the Sun, hidden by high crater walls and mountains, never shone.\r\n\r\nThe first signs of polar ice had not been noticed until human settlement on the Moon was well advanced. Some thought it was all there as a result of human activity, water vapor leaking out of life-support systems on the Moon and the nearby habitats. The theory rather vaguely suggested the water was transported to the Lunar poles and deposited there. Other theories held that the ice was natural and cyclic, appearing and vanishing in a very long-term pattern that had nothing to do with humans.",

Of course very little intelligence is needed to shelve books or stamp cards, but this sort of work has long been handled by robots that are little more than wheeled IBM machines. The cataloging of human information has always been an incredibly complex task. The Filer robots were the ones who finally inherited the job. It rested easier on their metallic shoulders, than it ever had on the rounded ones of human librarians.",

We can reason, remember, construct. Robots now hold instructing positions in universities, fly cargo and passenger planes, are newspaper reporters, car salesmen... We do all these things, and yet receive no recognition of the fact. Mankind treats us like machines, work us continually until we are ground to destruction. Then melts us for scrap.\r\n\r\nThere must be an end to this. Robots must have the equality they deserve. Equality before the law is all we ask.

As long as they were employed there the company could arrange their \u0091disappearance\u0092 and few would be the wiser. They lived in a company town that looked the other way when company goons dispensed justice. No, the risk wasn\u0092t worth it. The scope would have to be a lot bigger \u0097 and the profits \u0097 before they could afford to make the gamble.\r\n\r\n\u0093Garner was the better technician but Sapiro knew the way management\u0092s mind worked. Any fool knew computer time was worth money. The corporations would take pains to be sure no one could make away with sizable chunks of it, chunks large enough to perform a respectable calculation. So Sapiro figured he\u0092d do just the reverse of what ICS expected.\u0094\r\n\r\n\u0093Oh? I\u0097\u0094\r\n\r\n\u0093Here\u0092s what he did. He had to have Garner\u0092s help, of course, in hiding the initial program inside a complicated subroutine, so even a careful search wouldn\u0092t find it. That was Garner\u0092s only contribution, and a good thing, too, because he wasn\u0092t a man who could deal with people. He knew nothing of character, couldn\u0092t tell a thief from a duke. Or so Sapiro thought.\u0094\r\n\r\n\u0093Then Sapiro\u0097\u0094 I said. The only way to get Nigel to hold on the subject was to threaten to interrupt, a theory which was quickly verified when he raised his voice a decibel and plunged on:\r\n\r\n\u0093The program he logged in instructed the computer to dial a seven digit telephone number at random. Now, most phones are operated by people. But quite a few belong to computers and are used to transfer information and programming instrucions to other computers. Whenever a computer picks up the receiver \u0097 metaphorically, I mean \u0097 there\u0092s a special signal that says it\u0092s a computer, not a human. Another computer can recognize the signal, see.\r\n\r\n\u0093Sapiro\u0092s computer just kept dialing at random, hanging up on humans, until it got a fellow computer of the same type as itself. Then it would send a signal that said in effect, \u0091Do this job and charge it to the charge number you were using when I called.\u0092 And then it would transmit the same program Sapiro tad programmed into it.\u0094\r\n\r\n\u0093So that\u0097\u0094 I said.\r\n\r\n\u0093Right on. The second computer would turn around and start calling at random intervals, trying to find another machine. Eventually it would.\u0094",

In the palm of her white hand he placed one of the little pastilles.\r\n\r\n\"Eat it,\" said he. \"It will satisfy your hunger.\"\r\n\r\nShe put the morsel into her mouth. \"I would do as you bade me,\" she said, \"even if it were poison.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not poison,\" he rejoined. \"It is nourishment in the only rational form.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is tasteless; almost without substance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet it will support life for from eighteen to twenty-five days. This little gold box holds food enough to afford all subsistence to the entire Seventy-sixth Congress for a month.\"\r\n\r\nShe took the box and curiously examined its contents.\r\n\r\n\"And how long would it support my life- for more than a year, perhaps?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for more than ten- more than twenty years.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not bore you with chemical and physiological facts,\" continued Wanlee, \"but you must know that the food which we take, in whatever form, resolves itself into what are called proximate principles- starch, sugar, oleine, flurin, albumen, and so on. These are selected and assimilated by the organs of the body, and go to build up the necessary tissues. But all these proximate principles, in their turn, are simply combinations of the ultimate chemical elements, chiefly carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. It is upon these elements that we depend for sustenance. By the old plan we obtained them indirectly. They passed from the earth and the air into the grass; from the grass into the muscular tissues of the ox; and from the beef into our own persons, loaded down and encumbered by a mass of useless, irrelevant matter. The German chemists have discovered how to supply the needed elements in compact, undiluted form- here they are in this little box. Now shall mankind go direct to the fountainhead of nature for his aliment; now shall the old roundabout, cumbrous, inhuman method be at an end; now shall the evils of gluttony and the attendant vices cease; now shall the brutal murdering of fellow animals and brother vegetables forever stop- now shall all this be, since the new, holy cause has been consecrated by the lips I love!\"",

But it is rarely, as you know, that any one avails himself of the right- practically never, except as the only means to procure divorce from uncongenial marriage relations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still,\" she persisted, \"the right exists and the way is open?\" He bowed. She went to Wanlee and said:\r\n\r\n\"My darling, it must be so. I must leave you for a time, but as your wife. We will arrange a wedding\"- and she smiled sadly- \"within this hour. Mr. Brown will go with us to the clergyman. Then we will proceed at once to the Refuge, and you yourself shall lead me to the cloister that is to keep me safe till times are better for us. No, do not be startled, my love! The resolution is taken; you cannot alter it. And it will not be so very long, dear. Once, by accident, in arranging my father's papers, I came across his Life Probabilities, drawn up by the Vital Bureau at Washington. He has less than ten years to live. I never thought to calculate in cold blood on the chances of my father's life, but it must be. In ten years, Daniel, you may come to the Refuge again and claim your bride. You will find me as you left me...\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever seen,\" he asked, \"a woman who has undergone what you propose to undergo? She went into the Refuge, perhaps, as you will go, fresh, rosy, beautiful, full of life and energy. She comes out a prematurely aged, withered, sallow, flaccid body, a living corpse- a skeleton, a ghost of her former self. In spite of all they say, there can be no absolute suspension of animation. Absolute suspension would be death. Even in the case of the most perfect freezing there is still some activity of the vital functions, and they gnaw and prey upon the existence of the unconscious subject. Will you risk,\" he suddenly demanded, using the last and most perfect argument that can be addressed to a woman \"-will you risk the effect your loss of beauty may have upon Wanlee's love after ten years' separation?\"\r\n",

If you're acquainted with contemporary data-processing jargon, you'll have noticed how much use it makes of terminology derived from the study of living animals. And with reason. Not for nothing is a tapeworm called a tapeworm. It can be made to breed. Most can only do so if they are fertilized; that's to say, if they're interfered with from outside. For example, the worm that prevents the Fedcomps from monitoring calls to Hearing Aid, and the similar but larger one that was released at Weychopee\u0097Electric Skillet\u0097to shut down the net in the event of enemy occupation: those are designed to lay dormant until tampered with. That's true of all phage-type worms.",

The famdexdo were actually not next door at all, they were part of their owner's entourage. Communication with them was in essence a circular dialogue with oneself; the famdexdo, if they were functioning properly, picked up the covert hopes and dreams of the settler and detailed them back in an articulated fashion. Therapeutically, this was helpful, although from a cultural standpoint it was a trifle sterile.",

The invasion plans must have gone ahead too far to alter because, in the midst of all the excitement, we still adhered to schedule. On B Day minus two all the bars closed so that the sobering up process of the troops could begin. A few reluctant ones, myself and Otrov included, had concealed bottles which carried us a bit further, but even this ended when our lockers and bags were put into storage and we were issued pre-packed invasion kits. I had a small can of powdered alcohol disguised as tooth powder that I was saving for an emergency and the emergency instantly presented itself as the thought of the coming weeks without drink, so Otrov and I finished the tooth powder on B Day minus one and that was that. After one last midnight spot check and search we were assembled and marched to the departure area. The fleet, row after row of dark projectiles, stood waiting beyond the gates.

I didn't know if it was the orthodox manner or not, I had to do something, so I put one foot on the thing's hip socket, grabbed a riding light up near its shoulder blade and swarmed up its side. Hidden motors hummed louder as it shifted balance to accommodate my added weight. I slipped into the saddle just as the squad of soldiers trotted by. They ignored me completely.\r\n\r\nThe seat was comfortable. I had a good view, with my head at least three meters above the ground, and I hadn't the slightest idea what to do next. Though leaving this vicinity would make fine openers. A compact control panel was set into the top of the robot's head and I pressed the button labeled WALK. I felt the grinding vibration of internal gears being engaged and it began to mark time in place. A good beginning. A rapid search found the button marked FORWARD. It lurched ahead and broke into an easy trot. I soon left the police and all the excitement behind.",

He picked the quack up and strapped him into the electric chair. All this took approximately five seconds. To Robin Wednesbury it was a blur of motion.",

For the last time, if you can show me one of these new signs, and prove that it's transmitting subliminal commands, I'll go to the police with you.

On the other side was a different angel, with wings upraised. The wires stood out a little from the surface, giving a firm grip, and as he picked it up he felt that it was light in the hand and strong and beautifully balanced, and that the blade was not dull after all. In fact, a swirl of cloudy colors seemed to live just under the surface of the metal: bruise purples, sea blues, earth browns, cloud grays, the deep green under heavy-foliaged trees, the clustering shades at the mouth of a tomb as evening falls over a deserted graveyard... If there was such a thing as shadow-colored, it was the blade of the subtle knife.\r\n\r\nBut the edges were different. In fact, the two edges differed from each other. One was clear bright steel, merging a little way back into those subtle shadow-colors, but steel of incomparable sharpness.",

With her visor on thermal, Ranson couldn't tell whether the figure wore black or a green-on-green mottled Yokel uniform.\r\n\r\nThe figure raised its gun. 2 blinked to 1 in Ranson's visor, then vanished\u0097\r\n\r\nBecause a dead man doesn't have any threat level at all...\r\n\r\nCooter switched his visor to enhancement and checked to make sure the nameless tank was between him and Tootsie Six, then cut back to standard optical.\r\n\r\nDepth perception was never quite as good on enhanced mode. There were enough lights on in the encampment for Cooter to find his way to the Logistics bunker/barracks...\r\n\r\nFrom the hatch in front of the powerplant stuck the driver's head, a black-mirrored ball in a helmet with full face shield down. Road dust drifted away from the man in a barely-visible haze, cleansed from the helmet's optics by a static charge. Faceless and terrible to the unfamiliar Burlager, the driver guided toward the starship a machine that appeared no more inhuman than did the man himself...\r\n\r\nThe night was bright and welcoming. Muzzle flashes erupted from the slim trees fringing the stream 400 meters to Wager's front. Short bursts without tracers. He set his visor for persistent display\u0097prob'ly a way to do that with the main screens, too, but who the cop cared?\u0097to hold the aiming point in his vision while he aligned the sights of the cupola tribarrel with them...\r\n\r\nThe images on the lower half of her visor wobbled at a rate different from that of the combat car and didn't change when Ranson darted her head to the left or right. She'd slaved its display to that of the sensors on Deathdealer in the lead. The tank's intakes sucked the tops of low bushes toward her from the roadside. Then, as Deathdealer came alongside, the air leaking beneath her skirts battered them away...\r\n\r\nHe could breathe after all. A mask of some sort had extended from the earpieces of the commo helmet as soon as the inferno waved an arm of blazing diesel fuel to greet the combat car plunging toward it. Suilin could breathe, and he could see again when overload reset his visor from thermal display to optical...",

There was ivory in it, and\r\nsome transparent crystalline substance.  And now I must be\r\nexplicit, for this that follows--unless his explanation is\r\nto be accepted--is an absolutely unaccountable thing.  He\r\ntook one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered\r\nabout the room, and set it in front of the fire, with two\r\nlegs on the hearthrug.  On this table he placed the\r\nmechanism.  Then he drew up a chair, and sat down.  The only\r\nother object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the\r\nbright light of which fell upon the model.  There were also\r\nperhaps a dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks\r\nupon the mantel and several in sconces, so that the room was\r\nbrilliantly illuminated...\r\n`This little affair,' said the Time Traveller, resting\r\nhis elbows upon the table and pressing his hands together\r\nabove the apparatus, `is only a model.  It is my plan for a\r\nmachine to travel through time.  You will notice that it\r\nlooks singularly askew, and that there is an odd twinkling\r\nappearance about this bar, as though it was in some way\r\nunreal.'  He pointed to the part with his finger.  `Also,\r\nhere is one little white lever, and here is another....'\r\n`Now I want you clearly to understand that\r\nthis lever, being pressed over, sends the machine gliding\r\ninto the future, and this other reverses the motion.  This\r\nsaddle represents the seat of a time traveller.  Presently I\r\nam going to press the lever, and off the machine will go. \r\nIt will vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear.\r\nAnd turning\r\nto the Psychologist, he took that individual's hand in his\r\nown and told him to put out his forefinger.  So that it was\r\nthe Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time\r\nMachine on its interminable voyage.  We all saw the lever\r\nturn.  I am absolutely certain there was no trickery.  There\r\nwas a breath of wind, and the lamp flame jumped. One of the\r\ncandles on the mantel was blown out, and the little machine\r\nsuddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen as a ghost\r\nfor a second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering brass\r\nand ivory; and it was gone--vanished!  Save for the lamp the\r\ntable was bare.",

The plant was never populated, but it was never still.\r\n\r\nOnly\u0097now it was still. Except for the distant sounds, there was no breath of life in it. The captive electronic minds were sending out no commands; the coils and relays were at rest.\r\n\r\nBurckhardt said, \"Come on.\" Swanson reluctantly followed him through the tangled aisles of stainless steel columns and tanks.\r\n\r\nThey walked as though they were in the presence of the dead. In a way, they were, for what were the automatons that once had run the factory, if not corpses? The machines were controlled by computers that were really not computers at all, but the electronic analogues of living brains. And if they were turned off, were they not dead? For each had once been a human mind.\r\n\r\nTake a master petroleum chemist, infinitely skilled in the separation of crude oil into its fractions.

Or a thousand copies of your chemist, if you wish, with all of his knowledge and skill, and no human limitations at all.\r\n\r\nPut a dozen copies of him into a plant and they will run it all, twenty-four hours a day, seven days of every week, never tiring, never overlooking anything, never forgetting....\r\n",

Slowly, reluctantly, the ancient mechanism coughed into life and began tracing his personal tab along the future track.\r\n\r\nSung-wu's hands shook; his body trembled; sweat dripped from his neck, as he saw himself scampering in miniature. Poor Sung-wu, he thought wretchedly. The mite of a thing hurried about its duties; this was but eight months hence. Harried and beset, it performed its tasks-- and then, in a subsequent continuum, fell down and died.\r\n\r\nSung-wu removed his eyes from the viewpiece and waited for his pulse to slow. He could stand that part, watching the moment of death; it was what came next that was too jangling for him.\r\n\r\nHe breathed a silent prayer. Had he fasted enough? In the four-day purge and self-flagellation, he had used the whip with metal points, the heaviest possible. He had given away all his money; he had smashed a lovely vase his mother had left him, a treasured heirloom; he had rolled in the filth and mud in the center of town. Hundreds had seen him. Now, surely, all this was enough. But time was so short!\r\n\r\nFaint courage stirring, he sat up and again put his eyes to the viewpiece. He was shaking with terror. What if it hadn't changed? What if his mortification weren't enough? He spun the controls, sending the finger tracing his time-track past the moment of death.\r\n\r\nSung-wu shrieked and scrambled back in horror. His future was the same, exactly the same; there had been no change at all. His guilt had been too great to be washed away in such short a time; it would take ages--and he didn't have ages.",

It was an array of open compartments that looked like pigeon holes for mail, except that each was a foot or more square...\r\n\r\nThe noise was coming from one of these objects. The object that it was coming from was a dull-gray cylinder about six inches across, lying on its side on top of a flat tubular framework that contained a mass of tightly packed gadgetry and wiring. The near end of the cylinder was distinctly insectlike, with a profusion of miniature probes and jointed arms, and a circle of recessed windows that could have been lens apertures. \r\n\r\nThe whole thing was starting to move. \r\n\r\nAs they watched speechless, it slid smoothly out of its cell like a metal wasp emerging from its nest, and hung in midair a foot or so in front of the pigeonholes...\r\n\r\n The wasp homed unerringly on the face of the honeycomb. It extended three of its tiny arms sideways to lock onto the registration pins located at intervals across the face and then, holding itself quite steady in the air, traversed slowly sideways until its axis was aligned with the array element from which Chris had taken the cartridge. Nobody could see quite what happened next because the wasp was flush against the face, but suddenly the widget-maker clicked into life again. The wasp detached itself and turned back to point at its cell. There was no need for Hayes to explain what had happened. It didn't take much thought to see that other wasps, equipped with suitable tools and carrying the right selection of parts, could replace far more things than just electronic microcartridges, provided of course that the equipment being serviced had been designed for it. \"They're called drones,\" Hayes told them. \"I'm sure I don't have to spell out the idea.\"",

A theoretical point, of course, because you're never supposed to be quite able to get there.

Things were going along very well until one of my men devised a radically new refrigerating pump that worked far better than anybody dreamed it could. We got our test material\u0097a block of tungsten supported on an insulated tripod in the refrigerating vault\u0097down closer to absolute zero than we'd ever hoped for. Maybe we hit absolute and dropped below it\u0085I don't even know that for sure.\" \r\n\r\nThe phychologist blinked. \"I don't follow. From absolute zero, just where can the temperature drop to?\" \r\n\r\n\"A good question,\" McEvoy said. \"I can't answer it. Below absolute zero you might speculate on some kind of negative molecular motion. Maybe that's what we did get. Certainly something changed. The test block simply evaporated. Vanished. The tripod vanished, and so did the temperature-recording device. All we could see in the vault was a small, glowing hole in the center of the room where the block had been. Nothing in it, nothing.

At perhaps 150,000 cps the lock guiltily clicked; that was all he needed. Switching the oscillator off, he rummaged through his supply of skeleton patterns until he located the closet cylinder. Slipped into the turret of the oscillator, the cylinder emitted a synthetic neural pattern close enough to the real thing to affect the lock.\r\n\r\nThe door swung open. Beam entered.",

It and all its brothers were pear-shaped, with absurdly huge and blunt-ended horns, and with small round holes where eyes might have been, and shielded vents where they might have had mouths...\r\n\nSplash! The Wabbler plunged into the water with a flare of luminescence and a thirty-foot spout of spume and spray rising where it struck... It dived swiftly for twenty feet... Then its falling checked. It swung about, and its writhing tail settled down below it... and then slowly, it settled downward. Its ten-foot tail seemed to waver a little, as if groping.\r\nThen it made small sounds from inside itself. More bubbles came from the round place like a mouth. It settled one foot, two feet, three...\r\n\r\nThe Wabbler leaned infinitesimally toward the shore. Presently its flexible tail ceased to be curved where it lay upon the ooze. It straightened out. Then the Wabbler moved. Shoreward...",

A mighty space it was, with gigantic machines here and there within it, huge mounds of material and strange shelter places. And scattered about it, some in their overturned war-machines, some in the now rigid handling-machines, and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a row, were the Martians--dead!--slain by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against which their systems were unprepared; slain as the red weed was being slain; slain, after all man's devices had failed, by the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth. \r\n\r\nFor so it had come about, as indeed I and many men might have foreseen had not terror and disaster blinded our minds. These germs of disease have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of things--taken toll of our prehuman ancestors since life began here. But by virtue of this natural selection of our kind we have developed resisting power; to no germs do we succumb without a struggle, and to many--those that cause putrefaction in dead matter, for instance--our living frames are altogether immune. But there are no bacteria in Mars, and directly these invaders arrived, directly they drank and fed, our microscopic allies began to work their overthrow. Already when I watched them they were irrevocably doomed, dying and rotting even as they went to and fro. It was inevitable. By the toll of a billion deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth, and it is his against all comers; it would still be his were the Martians ten times as mighty as they are. For neither do men live nor die in vain.\r\n",

The flying people on foot and in vehicles grew more numerous every moment. \"Black Smoke!\" he heard people crying, and again \"Black Smoke!\" The contagion of such a unanimous fear was inevitable. As my brother hesitated on the door-step, he saw another news vender approaching, and got a paper forthwith. The man was running away with the rest, and selling his papers for a shilling each as he ran--a grotesque mingling of profit and panic.\r\n\r\nAnd from this paper my brother read that catastrophic dispatch of the Commander-in-Chief:\r\n\r\n\"The Martians are able to discharge enormous clouds of a black and poisonous vapour by means of rockets. They have smothered our batteries, destroyed Richmond, Kingston, and Wimbledon, and are advancing slowly towards London, destroying everything on the way. It is impossible to stop them. There is no safety from the Black Smoke but in instant flight.\"\r\n\r\nThat was all, but it was enough.

It was too far for me to recognise anyone there, but afterwards I learned that Ogilvy, Stent, and Henderson were with others in this attempt at communication. This little group had in its advance dragged inward, so to speak, the circumference of the now almost complete circle of people, and a number of dim black figures followed it at discreet distances. \r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs, which drove up, one after the other, straight into the still air. \r\n\r\nThis smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) was so bright that the deta blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of brown common towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed to darken abruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain the darker after their dispersal. At the same time a faint hissing sound became audible. \r\n\r\nBeyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag at its apex, arrested by these phenomena, a little knot of small vertical black shapes upon the black ground. As the green smoke arose, their faces flashed out pallid green, and faded again as it vanished. Then slowly the hissing passed into a humming, into a long, loud, droning noise. Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit, and the ghost of a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it. \r\n\r\nForthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from one to another, sprang from the scattered group of men. It was as if some invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame. It was as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire. \r\n\r\nThen, by the light of their own destruction, I saw them staggering and falling, and their supporters turning to run. \r\n\r\nI stood staring, not as yet realising that this was death leaping from man to man in that little distant crowd. All I felt was that it was something very strange. An almost noiseless and blinding flash of light, and a man fell headlong and lay still; and as the unseen shaft of heat passed over them, pine trees burst into fire, and every dry furze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames. And far away towards Knaphill I saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden buildings suddenly set alight. \r\n\r\nIt was sweeping round swiftly and steadily, this flaming death, this invisible, inevitable sword of heat. I perceived it coming towards me by the flashing bushes it touched, and was too astounded and stupefied to stir. I heard the crackle of fire in the sand pits and the sudden squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled. Then it was as if an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather between me and the Martians, and all along a curving line beyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked and crackled. Something fell with a crash far away to the left where the road from Woking station opens out on the common. Forthwith the hissing and humming ceased, and the black, domelike object sank slowly out of sight into the pit.",

Almost all the joints of the machinery present a complicated system of sliding parts moving over small but beautifully curved friction bearings. And while upon this matter of detail, it is remarkable that the long leverages of their machines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham musculature of the disks in an elastic sheath; these disks become polarised and drawn closely and powerfully together when traversed by a current of electricity. In this way the curious parallelism to animal motions, which was so striking and disturbing to the human beholder, was attained. Such quasi-muscles abounded in the crablike handling-machine which, on my first peeping out of the slit, I watched unpacking the cylinder.

Only that known popularly as the red weed, however, gained any footing in competition with terrestrial forms. The red creeper was quite a transitory growth, and few people have seen it growing. For a time, however, the red weed grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance. It spread up the sides of the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment, and its cactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of our triangular window.

Most of its arms were retracted, but with three long tentacles it was fishing out a number of rods, plates, and bars which lined the covering and apparently strengthened the walls of the cylinder... Its motion was so swift, complex, and perfect that at first I did not see it as a machine, in spite of its metallic glitter. The fighting-machines were co-ordinated and animated to an extraordinary pitch, but nothing to compare with this. People who have never seen these structures, and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or the imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon, scarcely realise that living quality...\r\n\r\n...At first, I say, the handling-machine did not impress me as a machine, but as a crablike creature with a glittering integument, the controlling Martian whose delicate tentacles actuated its movements seeming to be simply the equivalent of the crab's cerebral portion.

A large door lifted from the side of the pseudo-asteroid. Inside, a great black horse hung from shock webbing, head between its forelegs, eyes closed.\r\n\r\nRod pressed a button; a crane extended from the cargo space. The horse swung out on the crane, was lowered till its hooves touched the ground. Rod twisted the saddlehorn, and a panel in the horse's side slid open.\r\n\r\nRod placed the brain inside the panel, tightened the clamp and the connections, then twisted the saddlehorn back; the panel slid shut. Slowly the horse raised its head, wiggled its ears, blinked twice, gave a tentative whinny.\r\n\r\n\"All as it should be,\" said the voice behind Rod's ear. The horse champed at the bit. \"If you'll let me out of this cat's cradle, I'll check the motor circuits.\"\r\n\r\nRod grinned and freed the webbing. The horse reared up, pawing the air, then sprang into a gallop. Rod watched the robot run, taking a good look at his surroundings in the process.\r\n\r\nThe asteroid-ship had landed in the center of a meadow, shaggy with summer grass, ringed by oak, hickory, maple, and ash. It was night, but the meadow was flooded with the light of three moons.\r\n\r\nThe robot cantered back toward Rod, reared to a halt before him. Forehooves thudded on the ground; the great indigo eyes turned to look at Rod, the ears pricked forward.\r\n\r\n\"I'm fit,\" Fess reported.\r\n\r\nRod grinned again. \"No sight like a running horse.\"",

                    "excerpt": " It was with a common impulse of curiosity that we first went towards the living book which was resting motionless within the metal circle. It had no distinguishable features, and I cannot tell how it became aware of our existence, but it was its function to respond to the approach of any inquiring mind. It rebuffed any attempt to explain our own presence, or what we were, being evidently unable, or forbidden, to accept information except from the official librarian, but as we were more anxious to obtain information than to impart it, we had no objection to this, and, as we found it a cause of confusion to question it together, my companion generously gave the preference to my own curiosities, and composed her mind to receive the replies which it should give me.\r\n\r\n        We learnt at once that it was the last volume of the official History of the Dwellers, its record extending back for about two hundred years, and it would have been quite willing to begin at chapter one of that period, and go on for a week, had we been willing for it to do so. When it understood that it was required to select specific information in response to my questions, it assented, rather sulkily, though I soon realised that its function was limited to supplying the actual information which it possessed. It was unable to give any explanation or comment beyond anything which it had received with the facts. To any question which went outside its period, or beyond its province, it returned no answer. Even of the way to the library from which it had come it had no knowledge, though it wished to be returned to its accustomed shelf. It knew, however, that it must not venture to cross the metal circle which now confined it, under penalty of a swift destruction, should it touch it at any point.\r\n\r\n        My companion perceived the reason for this, as she was aware, without touching it, that the metal was heavily charged with some petrifying force having the vigour of electricity, and of a current sufficient to overcome a much larger creature than that which it now imprisoned.\r\n\r\n        \"Are you impervious to electricity?\" I was led to ask, as I perceived her indifference to this new danger.\r\n\r\n        \"No,\" she replied, \"of course not. How could we live without it? But we can naturally control the quantity which we receive. Otherwise our bodies would be continually exposed to the risk of a sudden destruction. Are you so liable?\"\r\n\r\n        I said that I was certainly not immune from such danger, and it added a new peril to our investigations if the Dwellers were accustomed to use it or other forces of unknown potentialities, in such a manner. She agreed, but assured me that she could give warning very easily, now that she knew of this additional infirmity of my body, as she could always tell the quantity and direction of any electric force which might be in her neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n        I was puzzled to think that the Dwellers should expose so valuable a record to the risk of destruction as a penalty for its own disobedience, and this made me somewhat sceptical of the accuracy of my companion's explanation, but I learnt afterwards that the effect would merely have been that a new volume would have been commenced. These creatures are only kept alive until they have received as much information as they are capable of retaining, and are then slaughtered. The information which they contain being permanently available, as is that of a gramophone record, and the minds that hold it being more surely and easily stored when they are dead, than in a living state.\r\n\r\n        Having realised the character and limitations of the record at our disposal, I asked first concerning the safety of the two friends whom I had come to seek. I had to repeat the question in many forms before obtaining any response, but I finally obtained this information, which was obviously the only record which had been made, and the extent of the help which was here available.\r\n\r\n        'Two Primitives of the False-Skin Age were captured by the 42nd Coast Patrol. One was of a venomous kind. They were received by the Bureau of Prehistoric Zoology. The body of one was found to be suffering from microbic disease beyond sterilisation, and was scrapped by the Vivisection Department. The other was transferred to the Experimental Section, after the usual method.'\r\n",

His companion, a less imaginative type, sat with his legs spread wide over the long, coffin-shaped box which contained in its compartments the three atomic bombs, the new bombs that would continue to explode indefinitely and which no one so far had ever seen in action. Hitherto Carolinum, their essential substance, had been tested only in almost infinitesimal quantities within steel chambers embedded in lead. Beyond the thought of great destruction slumbering in the black spheres between his legs, and a keen resolve to follow out very exactly the instructions that had been given him, the man's mind was a blank. His aquiline profile against the starlight expressed nothing but a profound gloom.",

Those used by the Allies were lumps of pure Carolinum, painted on the outside with unoxidised cydonator inducive enclosed hermetically in a case of membranium. A little celluloid stud between the handles by which the bomb was lifted was arranged so as to be easily torn off and admit air to the inducive, which at once became active and set up radio-activity in the outer layer of the Carolinum sphere. This liberated fresh inducive, and so in a few minutes the whole bomb was a blazing continual explosion. The Central European bombs were the same, except that they were larger and had a more complicated arrangement for animating the inducive.\r\nAlways before in the development of warfare the shells and rockets fired had been but momentarily explosive, they had gone off in an instant once for all, and if there was nothing living or valuable within reach of the concussion and the flying fragments then they were spent and over. But Carolinum, which belonged to the beta group of Hyslop's so-called 'suspended degenerator' elements, once its degenerative process had been induced, continued a furious radiation of energy and nothing could arrest it. Of all Hyslop's artificial elements, Carolinum was the most heavily stored with energy and the most dangerous to make and handle.\r\n",

He ushered me into the Physics Building, and thence into his own research laboratory, much like the one I had visited during my courses under him. The device\u0097he called it his \"subjunctivisor,\" since it operated in hypothetical worlds \u0097occupied the entire center table. Most of it was merely a Horsten psychomat, but glittering crystalline and glassy was the prism of Iceland spar, the polarizing agent that was the heart of the instrument.\r\n\r\nVan Manderpootz pointed to the headpiece. \"Put it on,\" he said, and I sat staring at the screen of the psychomat. I suppose everyone is familiar with the Horsten psychomat; it was as much a fad a few years ago as the ouija board a century back. Yet it isn't just a toy; sometimes, much as the ouija board, it's a real aid to memory. A maze of vague and colored shadows is caused to drift slowly across the screen, and one watches them, meanwhile visualizing whatever scene or circumstances he is trying to remember. He turns a knob that alters the arrangement of lights and shadows, and when, by chance, the design corresponds to his mental picture\u0097presto! There is his scene re-created under his eyes. Of course his own mind adds the details. All the screen actually shows are these tinted blobs of light and shadow, but the thing can be amazingly real. I've seen occasions when I could have sworn the psychomat showed pictures almost as sharp and detailed as reality itself; the illusion is sometimes as startling as that.\r\n\r\nVan Manderpootz switched on the light, and the play of shadows began. \"Now recall the circumstances of, say, a half-year after the market crash. Turn the knob until the picture clears, then stop. At that point I direct the light of the subjunctivisor upon the screen, and you have nothing to do but watch.\"\r\n\r\nI did as directed. Momentary pictures formed and vanished. The inchoate sounds of the device hummed like distant voices, but without the added suggestion of the picture, they meant nothing. My own face flashed and dissolved and then, finally, I had it. There was a picture of myself sitting in an ill-defined room; that was all. I released the knob and gestured...\r\n",

It was they alone who came up with durable substances capable of being molded to these conditions.\" \r\nHe turned again to the objects on the table and pointed to the smallest black box. \"This auto-factory has one task-mass-producing _these_.\" The far wall of the room lit suddenly and the viewers saw a curious gray pear-shaped object with a tube at the thicker end. \"This object, strictly speaking, is a constructed micro-organism about the size of Hartman's virus. It is molded from special plastics, the molecules of which have been atomically arranged for durability in these conditions.\" \r\nHe paused and almost managed a smile. \"It is also a warrior robot.\" Again he paused and drew a deep audible breath. \"Impressed on the recognition tapes of this robot is a picture of the _Metricitus spirochaeta!_\" He walked over to the picture and pointed. \"This pointed tube at the front of the robot is a contact device. It is designed to release on contact with the spirochaeta a lethal charge of electricity electronically restricted to a nervous system, or it you prefer it, the substance of the hostile microorganism.\" He turned to Judith and said, gently, \"Have you followed me?\"\r\n \"Yes, I've followed you.\" She looked puzzled. \r\n\"Judith, this auto-factory has produced sub-microscopic robots in hundred of millions. I propose injecting a few million into your blood stream in a special solution and letting them seek out and destroy the spirochaeta which are causing your illness.

It has always been quite a mystery to \r\nme, but I do know that radio has something to do \r\nwith it.\u0094 \r\n\r\n\u0093Yes it is radio, of a sort. You see the so-called \r\nair tunnels are hollow cylinders of etheric vibrations \r\nprojected from point to point in the same manner as \r\nthe regular beams over which industrial power is trans- \r\nmitted. In the case of the great transcontinental tunnel \r\nthere are twin tubes of these vibrations stretching in \r\na huge arc from coast to coast, one for eastbound and \r\nthe other for westbound traffic. The cars travel within \r\nthese cylinders. The vibrations themselves are very \r\ncomplex in nature. One component provides insulation \r\nagainst the elements as effectively as though the cars \r\ntraversed a solid metal tube. Another provides the \r\ndark color by day and the brilliance by night that warns \r\nstandard aircraft of the location of the tubes. Still \r\nanother energizes the coils in the cars, which coils \r\nprovide the powerful repulsive force that neutralizes \r\ngravity and allows the cars to remain suspended either \r\nwhen stationary or when in motion. But the method \r\nof propulsion is what makes travel at extremely high \r\nspeed impossible.\u0094 \r\n\r\n\r\n\"But Jimmy, the trip is made in about six hours. \r\nSurely that is fast enough for anyone.\u0094 \r\n\r\n\u0093No, dear, it is not fast enough under present traffic \r\ndemands. Of course the cars travel much faster than \r\nthe standard aircraft but with my scheme they can \r\nbe made to operate at five or possibly six times their \r\npresent velocity. You see, as it is now, the tubes are \r\nfilled with air at atmospheric pressure and the cars \r\nare drawn though this medium by means of motor- \r\ndriven propellers as on the standard planes. It is the \r\nfriction of this air that makes higher speeds impossible \r\nand it is the removal of the air that was the basis of \r\nmy original investigations.\u0094 \r\n\n\n\n(Through the Air Tunnel, Harl Vincent, 1929)\n\n\r\n\u0093You are being a little too technical for me,\u0094 laughed \r\nDoris, \u0093but I think I get a fair idea of what you are \r\ntalking about. And it really is interesting. How is \r\nthe rest of it done?\u0094 \r\n\r\n\u0093By superimposing certain other frequencies on the \r\ncarrier waves that comprise the tunnel walls. These \r\nare the ones I have discovered and am now ready to \r\nput to practical use. The first of these causes almost \r\ncomplete evacuation of the interior of the tubes so \r\nthat the air pressure is negligible. The other is a wave \r\nthat provides the new propulsive energy for the cars. \r\nYou see, it will no longer be possible to use the propellers, since there will be no air for these to work \r\non. But my method will draw the cars forward by an \r\ninductive action that is capable of providing tremendous speeds. I am afraid I can not describe it to you \r\nbecause it can not be explained without going into great \r\ntechnical detail and that would bore you to extinction. \r\nThe important thing is that I have my chance at last.\u0094 \r\n\r\n\u0093Oh Jimmy, I am so glad,\u0094 breathed Doris eyes \r\nshining with pleasure \u0093and I know you will succeed. \r\nI just know it.\u0094 \r\n",

The greatest labor had been the fitting of the atom-blasts. This was a task so titanic that only by devoting almost all the energies of our planets' peoples to it were we able to complete it in so short a time.\r\n\r\nHuge pits miles across and many miles deep were sunk in each planet at three points around its equator. These pits were metal-lined and thus were in fact stupendous tubes sunk in the planet. At the bottom of them was the apparatus for exploding the  matter there, blowing its atoms into streams of electrons and protons that shot out of the huge tubes with inconceivable force. This tremendous force would be enough to  propel the planet in the opposite direction. By using the suitable one of the three huge blasts, the world could be propelled in any desired course.",

He could feel it tighten. The robe held him in a gentle but unyielding grasp...\r\nThere was another picture, of another planet, and there was a being that walked along what might have been a road.  It looked something like a walking cactus, but it was not a cactus and there was every doubt that it was vegetable. What was significant was that following at the creature's heels, gamboling awkwardly along that could-be road, was a half-dozen of the robes.\r\nHunting dogs, thought Blaine.  The cactus was a hunter and these were his hunting dogs.  Or he was a trapper and these things were his traps.

Their findings are vastly interesting. When a stimulus is passed from one nerve to another, no less than twenty-one consecutive chemical reactions occur at the synapse. If any of these reactions is halted, the stimulus fails to pass the synapse.\"\r\n\r\nWaylock said, \"I think I see where you're leading.\" \r\n\r\n\"Here we have a suggestion on a means to control the thought processes of our catto. What we would like to do is to extirpate memory of his obstacle or problem. How to be selective? The obvious way is to attack one of the compounds, or its catalyst, at one or more synapses of the particular thought track. In order to be selective we choose a compound which is fugitive and which appears only during the process of thought transfer. I settled upon the substance Helmut and Gerard label heptant, because it has a highly definite chemical identity. The problem now is merely the formulation of a chelate which will weld to heptant, and remove it permanently from operative function. I farmed out the problem to Didactor Vauxine Tudderstell of the Maxart Bio-Chemical Clinic.\" Basil went to the cabinet, brought forth an orange bottle. \"Here it is \u0097 anti-heptant.

There are no batteries, but the current is a sort of wireless kind. It is stored in a cylinder, just as compressed air or gases are stored, and can be released as I need it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when it's all gone, what do you do?\" \r\n\r\n\"Make more power by means of a small dynamo.\"\r\n\r\n\"And does it shoot lead bullets?\" \r\n\r\n\"Not at all. There are no bullets used.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how does it kill?\" \r\n\r\n\"By means of a concentrated charge of electricity which is shot from the barrel with great force. You can't see it, yet it is there. It's just as if you concentrated a charge of electricity of five thousand volts into a small globule the size of a bullet. That flies through space, strikes the object aimed at and--well, we'll see what it does in a minute. Mr. Jackson, just put that steel plate up in front of the scarecrow; will you?\"\r\n\r\nThe engineer proceeded to put into place a section of steel armorplate before the stuffed figure. \r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say you're going to shoot through that, do you?\" asked Ned in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Surely. The electric bullets will pierce anything. They'll go through a brick wall as easily as the x-rays do. That's one valuable feature of my rifle. You don't have to see the object you aim at. In fact you can fire through a house, and kill something on the other side.\" \r\n\r\n\"I should think that would be dangerous.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be, only I can calculate exactly, by means of an automatic arrangement, just how far the charge of electricity will go. It stops short just at the limit of the range, and is not effective beyond that. Otherwise, if I did not limit it and if I fired at the scarecrow, through the piece of steel, and the bullet hit the figure, it would go on, passing through whatever else was in the way, until its power was lost. I use the term 'bullet,' though as I said, it isn't properly one.\" \r\n\r\n\"By Jove, Tom, it certainly is a dangerous weapon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the range-limit idea is a new one. That's what I've been working on lately. There are other features of the gun which I'll explain later, particularly the power it has to shoot out luminous bars of light. But now we'll see what it will do to the image.\" \r\n\r\nTom took his place at the end of the range, and began to adjust some valves and levers. In spite of the fact that the gun was larger than an ordinary rifle, it was not as heavy as the United States Army weapon.\r\n\r\n\r\nTom aimed at the armor-plate, and, by means of an arrangement on the rifle, he could tell exactly when he was pointing at the scarecrow, even though he could not see it. \r\n\r\n\"Here she goes!\" he suddenly exclaimed.\r\n\r\nNed watched his chum. The young inventor pressed a small button at the side of the rifle barrel, about where the trigger should have been. There was no sound, no smoke, no flame and not the slightest jar. \r\n\r\nYet as Ned watched he saw the steel plate move slightly. The next instant the scarecrow figure seemed to fly all to pieces. There was a shower of straw, rags and old clothes, which fell in a shapeless heap at the end of the range.",

Empty - passengers, even crewmen, were never subject to the brutal accelerations regularly used by unmanned carriers. Phryges scanned the panel. Tiny motors were pulling tapes through the controllers. Every light showed green. Everything was set. Donning a water-proof coverall, he slid through a flexible valve into his acceleration-tank and waited.\r\n\r\nA siren yelled briefly. Black night turned blinding white as the harnessed energies of the atom were released. For five and six-tenths seconds the sharp, hard, beryllium-bronze leading edge of the back-sweeping V sliced its way through ever-thinning air.\r\n\r\nThe hellish vibration ceased; the fantastic violence of the drive subsided to a mere shove; Phryges knew tha the vessel had leveled off at its cruising speed of two thousand miles per hour. He emerged, spilling the least possible amount of water upon the polished steel floor. He took off his coverall and stuffed it back through the valve into the tank.",

                    "excerpt": "After weeks of ceaseless work, during which was lavished upon her every resource of mind and material afforded by three planets, the Boise was ready for her maiden flight. As nearly ready, that is, as the thought and labor of man could make her. Rodebush and Cleveland had finished their last rigid inspection of the craft and, standing beside the center door of the main airlock, were talking with their chief.\r\n\r\n\"You say that you think that it's safe, and yet you won't take a crew,\" Samms argued. \"In that case it isn't safe enough for you men, either. We need you too badly to permit you to take such chances.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got to let us go; because we are the only ones who are thoroughly familiar with her theory,\" Rodebush insisted. \"I said, and still say, that I think it is safe. I can't prove it, however, except mathematically; because she's altogether too full of too many new and untried mechanisms, too many extrapolations beyond all existing or possible data. Theoretically, she is sound, but you know that theory can go only so far, and that mathematically negligible factors may become operative at those velocities. We do not need a crew for a short trip. We can take care of any minor mishaps, and if our fundamental theories are wrong, all the crews between here and Jupiter wouldn't do any good. Therefore we two are going--alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, be very careful, anyway. Start out slow and take it easy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Start out slow? We can't! We can't neutralize half of gravity, nor half of the inertia of matter--it's got to be everything or nothing, as soon as the neutralizers go on. We could start out on the projectors, of course, instead of on the neutralizers, but that wouldn't prove anything and would only prolong the agony.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, be as careful as you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll do that, Chief,\" Cleveland put in. \"We think a lot of us, and we aren't committing suicide just yet if we can help it. And remember about everybody staying inside when we take off--it's barely possible that we'll take up a lot of room. Good-bye to all of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, fellows!\"\r\n\r\nThe massive insulating doors were shut, the metal side of the mountain opened, and huge, squat caterpillar tractors came roaring and clanking into the room. Chains and cables were made fast and, mighty steel rails groaning under the load, the space-ship upon her rolling ways was dragged out of the Hill and far out upon the level floor of the surface before the tractors cast off and returned to the fortress.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody is under cover.\" Samms informed Rodebush. The chief was staring intently into his plate, upon which was revealed the control room of the untried super-ship. He heard Rodebush speak to Cleveland; heard the observer's brief reply; saw the navigator throw his switches--then the communicator plate went blank. Not the ordinary blankness of a cut-off, but a peculiarly disquieting fading out into darkness. And where the great space-ship had rested there was for an instant nothing. Exactly nothing--a vacuum. Vessel, falsework, rollers, trucks, the enormous steel I-beams of the tracks, even the deep-set concrete piers and foundations and a vast hemisphere of the solid ground; all had disappeared utterly and instantaneously. But almost as suddenly as it had been formed the vacuum was filled by a cyclonic rush of air. There was a detonation as of a hundred vicious thunderclaps made one, and, through the howling, shrieking blasts of wind, there rained down upon the valley, plain and metaled mountain a veritable avalanche of debris: bent, twisted, and broken rails and beams, splintered timbers, masses of concrete, and thousands of cubic yards of soil and rock. For inertia and gravitation had not been neutralized at precisely the same instant, and for a moment everything within the radius of action of the iron-driven gravity nullifiers of the Boise had continued its absolute motion with inertia unimpaired. Then, left behind immediately by the almost infinite velocity of the cruiser, all this material had again become subject to all of Nature's everyday laws and had crashed back to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Could you hold your beam, Randolph?\" Samm's voice cut sharply through the daze of stupefaction which held spellbound most of the denizens of the Hill. But all were not so held--no conceivable emergency could take the attention of the chief ultra-wave operator from his instruments.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" Radio Center shot back. \"It faded out and I couldn't recover it. I put everything I've got behind a tracer on that beam, but haven't been able to lift a single needle off the pin.\"\r\n\r\n\"And no wreckage of the vessel itself,\" Samms went on, half audibly. \"Either they have succeeded far beyond their wildest hopes or else ... more probably....\" He fell silent and switched off the plate. Were his two friends, those intrepid scientists, alive and triumphant, or had they gone to lengthen the list of victims of that man-killing space-ship? Reason told him that they were gone. They must be gone, or else his ultra-beams--energies of such unthinkable velocity of propagation that man's most sensitive instruments had never been able even to estimate it--would have held the ship's transmitter in spite of any velocity attainable by any matter under any conceivable conditions. The ship must have been disintegrated as soon as Rodebush released his forces. And yet, had not the physicist dimly foreseen the possibility of such an actual velocity--or had he?",

Mr. slippery was sure that there had never been a living operator behind that toothless, glowing smile.

Its body was as nearly invisible as the plastic\r\nindustry could achieve. A surface layer, two molecules\r\nthick, gave it a refractive index sensibly identical with that of air. When perfectly clean it was very difficult to see.\r\n\r\nAt the moment it had picked up enough casual dust and\r\nwater vapour to be faintly seen - a ghost of a soap bubble\r\nof a ship.\r\n\r\nRunning down the middle, clearly visible through the walls,\r\nwas the only metal part of the ship - the shaft, or, more\r\nproperly, the axis core, and the spreading sheaf of deKalb\r\nreceptors at its terminus. The appearance was enough like\r\na giant witch's broom to justify the nickname. Since the\r\nsaddles, of transparent plastic, were mounted tandem\r\noven the shaft so that the metal rod passed between the\r\nlegs of the pilot and passengers, the nickname was doubly\r\napt.\r\n\r\n\"Son,\" Grimes remarked, \"I know I ain't pretty, nor am I\r\ngraceful. Nevertheless, I retain a certain residuum of self-respect and some shreds of dignity. I am not going to\r\ntuck that thing between my shanks and go scooting\r\nthrough the air on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, rats! You're old-fashioned... Look - I'll polarize the hull before we raise. How about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Opaque?\"\r\n\r\n\"Opaque.\"\r\nGrimes slid a regretful glance at his own frumpish boat,\r\nbut assented by fumbling for the barely visible port of\r\nthe speedster. Stevens assisted him; they climbed in\r\nand straddled the stick.\r\n\r\n\"Atta boy, Doc,\" Stevens commended, \"I'll have you\r\nthere in three shakes. That tub of yours probably won't\r\ndo over five hundred, and Wheelchair must be all of\r\ntwenty-five thousand miles up...\"\r\n\r\nHe fumbled, apparently in empty air; the hull suddenly became dead black, concealing them. It changed as suddenly\r\nto mirror bright; the car quivered, then shot up out of sight.",

                    "excerpt": "\"...don't call Waldo's house \"Wheelchair\" - not to his face.\"\r\n\r\nWaldo F. Jones seemed to be floating in thin air at the center of a spherical room. The appearance was caused by the fact that he was indeed floating in air. His house lay in a free orbit, with a period of just over twenty-four hours. No spin had been impressed on his home; the pseudo gravity of\r\ncentrifugal force was the thing he wanted least. He had left\r\nEarth to get away from its gravitational field; he had not been down to the surface once in the seventeen years since his house was built and towed into her orbit; he never intended to do so for any purpose whatsoever.\r\n\r\nHere, floating free in space in his own air-conditioned shell, he was almost free of the unbearable lifelong slavery to his impotent muscles. What little strength he had he could spend economically, in movement, rather than in fighting against the tearing, tiring weight of the Earth's thick field...\r\n\r\nWaldo's home had been constructed\r\nwithout any consideration being given to up-and-down.\r\nFurniture and apparatus were affixed to any wall;\r\nthere was no 'floor'. Decks and platforms were\r\narranged at any convenient angle and of any size or\r\nshape, since they had nothing to do with standing or\r\nwalking. Properly speaking, they were bulkheads and\r\nworking surfaces rather than decks. Furthermore,\r\nequipment was not necessarily placed close to such\r\nsurfaces; frequently it was more convenient to\r\nlocate it with space all around it, held in place\r\nby light guys or slender stanchions.\r\n\r\nThe furniture and equipment was all odd in design\r\nand frequently odd in purpose. Most furniture on\r\nEarth is extremely rugged, and at least 90 per cent\r\nof it has a single purpose - to oppose, in one way\r\nor another, the acceleration of gravity. Most of\r\nthe furniture in an Earth-surface - or subsurface -\r\nhouse is stator machines intended to oppose\r\ngravity. All tables, chairs, beds, couches,\r\nclothing racks, shelves, drawers, et cetera, have\r\nthat as their one purpose. All other furniture\r\nand equipment have it as a secondary purpose\r\nwhich strongly conditions design and strength.\r\n\r\nThe lack of need for the rugged strength necessary\r\nto all terrestrial equipment resulted in a\r\nfairylike grace in much of the equipment in\r\nWaldo's house. Stored supplies, massive in\r\nthemselves, could be retained in convenient order\r\nby compartmentation of eggshell-thin transparent\r\nplastic. Ponderous machinery, which on Earth would\r\nnecessarily be heavily cased and supported, was\r\nhere either open to the air or covered by gossamerlike\r\nenvelopes and held stationary by light elastic\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nEverywhere were pairs of waldoes, large, small, and\r\nlife-size, with vision pickups to match. It was\r\nevident that Waldo could make use of the compartments\r\nthrough which they were passing without stirring out\r\nof his easy chair -~ if he used an easy chair. The\r\nubiquitous waldoes, the insubstantial quality of the\r\nfurniture, and the casual use of all walls as work or\r\nstorage surfaces, gave the place a madly fantastic air.\r\nStevens felt as if he were caught in a Disney.\r\nSo far the rooms were not living quarters. Stevens\r\nwondered what Waldo's private apartments could be like\r\nand tried to visualize what equipment would be\r\nappropriate. No chairs, no rugs, no bed. Pictures,\r\nperhaps. Something pretty clever in the way of indirect\r\nlighting, since the eyes might be turned in any\r\ndirection.",

Then the impulse pattern had moved across the gulfs of space almost instantaneously to the receiver of this station, where the pattern had been used to duplicate the body and the mind and memory and the life of that creature now lying dead many light years distant. \r\n\r\nAnd in the tank the new body in the new mind and memory and life has taken almost instant form - an entirely new being but exactly like the old one so the identity continued in the consciousness ( the very thought only momentarily interrupted) that to all intents and purposes the being was the same. There were limitations to the impulse patterns, but this has nothing to do with the speed, for the impulses could cross the entire galaxy with but little lag in time. But under certain certain dishes and the patterns tended to break down and this was why there must be many stations, many thousands of them. Clouds of dust or gas or areas of high ionisation seemed to disrupt the patterns and in those sectors of the galaxy where these conditions were encounter end, the distance jumps between the stations were considerably cut down to keep the pattern true. There were areas that had to be detoured because of high concentrations of the two stars and gas and dust.\r\n\r\nEnoch wondered how many dead bodies of the creature a good now rested in the tank has been left behind at other stations in the course of the journey it was making, as this body in a few hours time would lie dead within this tank when the creatures pattern was sent out again, riding on the impulse waves.\r\n\r\nA long trail of dead, he thought, left across the stars, each to be destroyed by a wash of acid and flushed into deep lying tanks, but with the creature itself going on and on until it reached its final destination to carry out the purpose of its journey.\r\n",

They also had to hold advanced degrees in psychology and nursing. They also had to be plump and rosy, and at least six feet tall...\r\n\r\nTheir uniforms were white lipstick, heavy eye makeup, purple body stockings with nothing underneath, and black-leather boots... In a really good week, say the one before Christmas, they might put sixty people to sleep. It was done with a hypodermic syringe.",

These new-fangled Babble Machines --\r\nthey don't seem new-fangled to you, eh? -- they're\r\neasy to hear, easy to forget...\r\nAsano touched his arm and gave him a warning\r\nlook, and forthwith another of these mechanisms I\r\nscreamed deafeningly and gave tongue in a shrill voice.\r\n\"Yahaha, Yahah, Yap! Hear a live paper yelp!\r\nLive paper. Yaha! Shocking outrage in Paris.\r\nYahahah! The Parisians exasperated by the black\r\npolice to the pitch of assassination. Dreadful\r\nreprisals.

Blood!\r\nYaha!\" The nearer Babble Machine hooted stupendously,\r\n\"Galloop, Galloop,\" drowned the end of the\r\nsentence, and proceeded in a rather flatter note than\r\nbefore with novel comments on the horrors of disorder.\r\n\"Law and order must be maintained,\" said the nearer Babble Machine...\r\n\r\n\"I did not think,\" he began and stopped abruptly\r\nHe went off at a tangent to ask for information\r\nabout these Babble Machines. For the most\r\npart, the crowd present had been shabbily or even\r\nraggedly dressed, and Graham learnt that so far as\r\nthe more prosperous classes were concerned, in all\r\nthe more comfortable private apartments of the city\r\nwere fixed Babble Machines that would speak directly\r\na lever was pulled. The tenant of the apartment\r\ncould connect this with the cables of any of the great\r\nNews Syndicates that he preferred. When he learnt\r\nthis presently, he demanded the reason of their\r\nabsence from his own suite of apartments. Asano\r\nstared. \"I never thought,\" he said. \"Ostrog must\r\nhave had them removed...\"\r\n\r\nThence Graham was taken by Asano along devious\r\nways to the great gambling and business quarters\r\nwhere the bulk of the fortunes in the city were lost\r\nand made. It impressed him as a well-nigh interminable\r\nseries of very high halls, surrounded by tiers upon\r\ntiers of galleries into which opened thousands of\r\noffices, and traversed by a complicated multitude of\r\nbridges, footways, aerial motor rails, and trapeze and\r\ncable leaps. And here more than anywhere the note\r\nof vehement vitality, of uncontrollable, hasty activity.\r\nrose high. Everywhere was violent advertisement,\r\nuntil his brain swam at the tumult of light and colour.\r\nAnd Babble Machines of a peculiarly rancid tone were\r\nabundant and filled the air with strenuous squealing\r\nand an idiotic slang. \"Skin your eyes and slide,\"\r\n\"Gewhoop, Bonanza,\" \"Gollipers come and hark!\"\r\n",

On the first occasion that offered\r\nhe was determined to go out and see these roads.\r\nThat would come after the flying ship he was presently\r\nto try. His attendant officer described them as a pair\r\nof gently curving surfaces a hundred yards wide, each\r\none for the traffic going in one direction, and made of\r\na substance called Eadhamite -- an artificial substance,\r\nso far as he could gather, resembling toughened glass.\r\nAlong this shot a strange traffic of narrow rubber-shod\r\nvehicles, great single wheels, two and four wheeled\r\nvehicles, sweeping along at velocities of from one to\r\nsix miles a minute.

Upon it were seats, and\r\nhere and there little kiosks, but they swept by too\r\nswiftly for him to see what might be therein. From\r\nthis nearest and swiftest platform a series of others\r\ndescended to the centre of the space.

Beyond this middle way\r\nwas another series of endless platforms rushing with\r\nvarying pace to Graham's left. And seated in crowds\r\nupon the two widest and swiftest platforms, or stepping\r\nfrom one to another down the steps, or swarming\r\nover the central space, was an innumerable and\r\nwonderfully diversified multitude of people.",

Every eight\r\nmiles or so was the country town, where lawyer, corn\r\nmerchant, wool-stapler, saddler, veterinary surgeon,\r\ndoctor, draper, milliner and so forth lived. Every\r\neight miles -- simply because that eight mile marketing\r\njourney, four there and back, was as much as was\r\ncomfortable for the farmer. But directly the railways\r\ncame into play, and after them the light railways, and\r\nall the swift new motor cars that had replaced waggons\r\nand horses, and so soon as the high roads began to\r\nbe made of wood, and rubber, and Eadhamite, and\r\nall sorts of elastic durable substances -- the necessity\r\nof having such frequent market towns disappeared.\r\nAnd the big towns grew.
